Subject:	Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence (Artificial Intelligence Act) and amending certain Union legislative acts
- Analysis of the final compromise text with a view to agreement

I.	INTRODUCTION
1.	The Commission adopted the proposal for a Regulation laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence (Artificial Intelligence Act, hereinafter: the AI Act) on 21 April 2021.

2.	The Council unanimously adopted its General Approach on the proposal on 6 December 2022, while the European Parliament (hereinafter: the EP) confirmed its position in a plenary vote on 14 June 2023.

3.	On 14 June 2023, 18 July 2023, 2-3 October 2023 and 24 October 2023 the first four political trilogues were held, during which some of the less controversial parts of the proposal were agreed and compromise was also found on the provisions concerning measures in support of
 
innovation, as well as and on the mechanism for classification of AI systems as high-risk. Moreover, during those initial trilogues the co-legislators explored potential landing zones with regard to the remaining issues, in particular the regulation of general purpose AI models and systems, governance, as well the prohibitions and law enforcement package.

4.	On 29 November 2023 and 1 December 2023, the Committee of Permanent Representatives granted the Presidency a revised mandate to continue the negotiations on all the outstanding elements of the proposal. The fifth and final trilogue was held between 6 and 8 December 2023. During this extended round of negotiations the Council and the EP came to an agreement on all political issues and successfully closed the interinstitutional negotiations. Following this political agreement, the co-legislators proceeded to carry out further technical work in January 2024 in order to align the text of the recitals with the text of the articles as agreed during the final trilogue.

5.	In the Annex to this document delegations will find the text of the proposal for a Regulation laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence (the AI Act), updated according to the provisional political agreement reached at the fifth trilogue between 6 and 8 December 2023.

II.	MAIN ELEMENTS OF THE COMPROMISE
1.	Subject matter and scope

As regards the subject matter, the compromise text of Article 1(1) includes a high-level statement that one of the purposes of the AI Act is to ensure a high level of protection of health, safety and fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter, which includes democracy, rule of law and environmental protection. However, all subsequent references in the text to the risks addressed by the Regulation only include risks to health, safety and fundamental rights, in line with the Council’s mandate.

Concerning the scope, the compromise text makes it clear that national security is excluded. The wording concerning this exclusion in Article 2(3) has been fine tuned to align it more closely with the respective language used in recently agreed legal acts, such as the Cyber Resilience Act and the Data Act, while the text of the corresponding Recital 12a has remained the same as in the Council’s mandate.
 
2.	Definition of an AI system

The definition of an AI system in Article 3(1) has been modified to align it more closely with the work of international organisations working on artificial intelligence, notably the OECD. Moreover, the corresponding Recital 6 details further the key characteristics of the definition and clarifies that the definition is not intended to cover simpler traditional software systems or programming approaches, which are based on the rules defined solely by natural persons to automatically execute operations. Additionally, the Commission has been tasked to develop guidelines on the application of the definition of an AI system.

3.	Prohibited AI practices

Regarding the list of prohibited AI practices in Article 5, the compromise text includes the changes as previously accepted by the Committee of Permanent Representatives in the Council’s revised mandate. This means that the list includes the prohibition of real-time biometric identification by law enforcement authorities in publicly accessible spaces, but with some notable and clearly defined exceptions, as listed in Article 5(1)(d), which are now subject to a range of safeguards, including monitoring and oversight measures and limited reporting obligations at EU level. Additional accepted prohibitions include untargeted scraping of facial images for the purpose of a creating or expanding facial recognition databases, emotion recognition but only at the workplace and in educational institutions (and with exceptions for safety and medical reasons), a very limited prohibition of biometric categorization based on certain specific beliefs or characteristics, as well as a limited and targeted ban on individual predictive policing. The wording on the predictive policing ban has been slightly modified and it now covers systems which assess or predict the risk of a natural person to commit a criminal offence, based solely on the profiling of a natural person or on assessing their personality traits and characteristics. However, this prohibition will not apply to AI systems used to support the human assessment of the involvement of a person in a criminal activity.

Finally, it is important to point out that as part of the compromise other biometric categorisation systems and emotion recognition systems, as well as post-remote biometric identification systems, which have not been included in the list of prohibitions in Article 5,
 
have been added to Annex III (List of high-risk AI systems), with some further limitations of their scope.

4.	Post-remote biometric identification

In addition to being included in the list of high-risk AI systems in Annex III, the use of post-remote biometric identification by law enforcement authorities has been made subject to some additional safeguards in Article 29. These safeguards include some limited transparency measures and the requirement for law enforcement authorities to request an authorisation for the use of post-remote biometric identification, which could be given by a judicial authority or an administrative authority whose decision is binding and subject to a judicial review. This can be done prior or ex post, within 48 hours. Furthermore, the compromise text clarifies that post-remote biometric identification should not be used for law enforcement purposes in an untargeted way without any link to a criminal offence, a criminal proceeding, a genuine and present or genuine and foreseeable threat of a criminal offence or the search for a specific missing person.

5.	Exceptions for law enforcement authorities

The compromise agreement preserves all the exceptions for law enforcement authorities that were added in the Council’s revised mandate, including derogation from conformity assessment and the possibility to start real world testing of high-risk AI systems without prior authorisation. Nevertheless, in order to secure these concessions, the Council had to agree that market surveillance authorities for high-risk AI systems in the field of law enforcement would be either the data protection authorities or any other authorities designated pursuant to conditions laid down in Articles 1 to 44 of the Law Enforcement Directive.

6.	Fundamental rights impact assessment

In line with the Council’s revised mandate, in Article 29a the compromise text includes a light version of the obligation for some deployers to conduct a fundamental rights impact assessment. The obligation is relatively easy to comply with, and it concerns only deployers that are bodies governed by public law, private actors providing public services, and
 
deployers that are banking and insurance service providers using AI systems listed as high- risk in Annex III, point 5, (b) and (ca). The fundamental rights impact assessment will need to be carried out only for aspects not covered by other legal obligations, such as Data Protection Impact Assessment under the GDPR and will be procedurally aligned with existing processes in order to eliminate any overlap and additional burden. Moreover, compliance with this obligation will be facilitated by the AI Office, which has been tasked with the development of a template for a questionnaire which deployers will be able to use to meet the relevant requirements.

7.	Testing high-risk AI systems in real world conditions outside AI regulatory sandboxes

As part of the compromise, the text of the AI Act includes provisions on testing high-risk AI systems in real world conditions outside AI regulatory sandboxes, in Articles 54a and 54b. The Council’s revised mandate has been preserved in this respect, which means that testing high-risk AI systems in real world conditions outside AI regulatory sandboxes will be possible, but it will be subject to a range of safeguards, which include, inter alia, the requirement for approval from the market surveillance authority, the right for affected persons to request to delete their data after testing in real world conditions, the right for market surveillance authorities to request information related to testing in real world conditions from providers, including the power to conduct inspections, limited duration of such testing, as well as some additional safeguards designed specifically for testing in real world conditions in the areas of law enforcement, migration, asylum and border control management.

8.	General purpose AI models

The compromise agreement includes new provisions concerning general purpose AI models (GPAI models) in Articles 52a – 52e. These new rules introduce horizontal obligations for all GPAI models, which will include keeping up-to-date and making available, upon request, technical documentation to the AI Office and national competent authorities. They also include providing certain information and documentation to downstream providers for the purpose of compliance with the AI Act. There are some additional requirements for models with systemic risks, which would include performing model evaluation, making risk assessments  and  taking  risk  mitigation  measures,  ensuring  an  adequate  level  of
 
cybersecurity protection, and reporting serious incidents to the AI Office and national competent authorities. Compliance with these requirements can be achieved through codes of practice, which will be developed by the industry, with the participation of the Member States (through the AI Board), and facilitated by the AI Office. The drawing up of the codes of practice should be an open process to which all interested stakeholders will be invited, both companies as well as civil society and academia. The AI Office will also evaluate these codes of practice and can formally approve them, or, in case they are inadequate to cover the obligations, provide common rules for the implementation of the obligations through an implementing act. The compromise agreement also provides that standards will be a possibility for compliance in the future.

Classification of GPAI models as presenting systemic risks will initially depend on the capability, either based on a quantitative threshold of the cumulative amount of compute used for its training measured in floating point operations (FLOPs), or on an individual designation decision of the Commission that takes into account criteria listed in Annex IXc (e.g. the number of parameters, quality and size of the dataset, input and output modalities or the reach measures in business users).The initial FLOPs threshold for this has been set as 10^25, so higher than what the EP initially wanted but lower than in the Council’s mandate, which was 10^26. However, in this context it is important to note that the Commission will be obliged to adapt the threshold in the light of evolving technological developments, such as algorithmic improvements or increased hardware efficiency, in order to keep up with the state of the art, reflecting the capabilities recorded in the most advanced general purpose AI models.

Regarding copyright, the compromise agreement states that providers of GPAI models will need to put in place a policy to respect Union copyright law, as well as make publicly available a sufficiently detailed summary about the content used for training of the general- purpose AI model, based on a template provided by the AI Office. Recital 60k explains that this summary should not be technically detailed but comprehensive at a general level, while taking into due account the need to protect trade secrets and confidential business information.

Finally, with regard to GPAI systems, the compromise agreement defines them as AI systems based on GPAI models that can serve a variety of purposes. Article 28 includes
 
rules to align them to the risk-based approach of the AI Act. Providers of such systems will be obliged to provide all the information and elements to downstream providers of high-risk AI systems so that they can comply with the respective requirements, including for the purpose of conformity assessment. Article 63a further clarifies the conditions in which national market surveillance authorities should collaborate with the AI Office to ensure the compliance of GPAI systems that can be used directly by deployers for at least one purpose classified as high-risk, when they consider the GPAI systems are not compliant.

9.	Governance and enforcement

Linked to the agreements on GPAI models, as summarized in point 8 above, the compromise text also includes the new rules on governance in Title VI. While for AI systems the market surveillance system on the national level will apply, these new rules for GPAI models provide for a new more centralised system of oversight and enforcement. For this purpose, the AI Office will be established as a new governance structure with a number of specific tasks in respect of GPAI models, and with a strong link with the scientific community to support its work.

The newly proposed governance structure also includes an enhanced role for the AI Board. Its list of tasks has been extended to give the Member States a stronger coordination role, including with regard to AI regulatory sandboxes, consultations with stakeholders and awareness raising activities. The AI Board will also provide opinions to the Commission on the qualified alerts concerning general purpose AI models. The provisions on the composition and functioning of the AI Board have been maintained as in the Council’s General Approach.

The final text also introduces two new advisory bodies. A scientific panel of independent experts will provide technical advice and input to the AI Office and market surveillance authorities. The scientific panel also has a key role in the enforcement of rules for GPAI models, as it will be able to launch qualified alerts of possible risks to the AI Office. Building on the General Approach, Member States will have the possibility to call upon experts of the scientific panels to support their market surveillance activities. An advisory forum will provide stakeholder input to the Commission (including the AI Office) and to the
 
AI Board. It will comprise a balanced selection of stakeholders, including industry, start- ups, SMEs, civil society and academia.

Finally, on the issue of appointing more than one competent authority covered by Article 59(2), the compromise text maintains the Council’s position, which gives the Member States the flexibility to appoint at least one notifying authority and at least one market surveillance authority as national competent authorities. In addition, Member States shall designate one market surveillance authority to act as a single point of contact.

10.	Derogation from conformity assessment

In line with the Council’s mandate, the compromise text preserves the derogation from conformity assessment in Article 47(1), and also the related exemption (urgency procedure) for law enforcement authorities in Article 47(1a), without the need for judicial authorisation. However, to secure this concession, it has been necessary to re-introduce in the text the wording regarding the control of the authorisation process by the Commission, as provided in points 3, 4 and 5 of Article 47, which were previously deleted in the Council’s General Approach.

11.	AI systems already placed on the market or put into service

Concerning AI systems already placed on the market or put into service, in the case of public authorities which are providers or deployers of high-risk AI systems the compromise agreement in Article 83(2) is to offer them 4 years from the entry into application to make their systems compliant. This change does not depart significantly from the Council’s position, as it is highly unlikely that within this 4-year period such systems would not go through a substantial modification, which was supposed to trigger the requirement to comply in the Council’s General Approach. Moreover, in Article 83(3) it has been agreed that every GPAI model that is placed on the market before the entry into application of the provisions related to GPAI models (12 months after entry into force) will have 2 years after the date if entry into application of these provisions (3 years in total) to be brought in compliance (irrespective of whether there is a substantial modification or not).

12.	Implementing acts and delegated acts
 
With regard to delegated and implementing acts, the compromise text preserves the choices as in the Council’s revised mandate, with the exception of two cases of implementing acts where it was clarified that legally only delegated acts are possible, namely to update the thresholds of FLOPs in Article 52a and to update the methodology for the classification of high-impact models in Article 52b.

13.	Penalties

The amounts of penalties for the infringements of the various aspects of the AI Act have been fine tuned in Article 71. Notably, for non-compliance with the provisions concerning prohibited AI practices outlined in Article 5, the penalty has been set at 35 million EUR or 7% of annual turnover, slightly above the limit set in the Council’s revised mandate, which was 35 million EUR or 6.5% of annual turnover. On the other hand, the amounts of penalties agreed for the remaining cases are slightly lower than in the Council’s position.

Finally, Article 72a sets out the fines for providers of general purpose AI models, in case of infringements of the obligations or non-compliance with the enforcement measures, e.g. requests for information. The maximum amount of fines has been aligned to those for providers of high-risk AI systems. It is important to highlight that there will be an additional grace period for providers of general purpose AI models, because no fines can be imposed during the first year after entry into application of the rules.

14.	Entry into application

On the entry of application as specified in Article 85, the compromise agreement provides for 24 months with regard to most parts of the Regulation, with slightly shorter deadlines for some elements, namely 6 months for prohibitions and 12 months for provisions concerning notifying authorities and notified bodies, governance, general purpose AI models, confidentiality and penalties, and a slightly longer deadline of 36 months for high-risk AI systems covered by Annex II.



III.	CONCLUSION
 
1.	The Presidency invites the Committee of the Permanent Representatives to:
a.	endorse the annexed compromise text as agreed with the European Parliament during the final trilogue, and
b.	mandate the Presidency to inform the European Parliament that, should the European Parliament adopt its position at first reading, in accordance with Article 294 paragraph 3 of the Treaty, in the form set out in the compromise package contained in the Annex to this document (subject to revision by the lawyer linguists of both institutions), the Council would, in accordance with Article 294, paragraph 4 of the Treaty, approve the European Parliament’s position and the act shall be adopted in the wording which corresponds to the European Parliament’s position.



 
ANNEX
2021/0106 (COD)

Proposal for a

REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

LAYING DOWN HARMONISED RULES ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ACT) AND AMENDING CERTAIN UNION LEGISLATIVE ACTS



THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 16 and 114 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,

After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,

Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee1, Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank2,
Having regard to the joint opinion of the European Data Protection Board and the European Data Protection Supervisor,
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions3, Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, Whereas:
(1)	The purpose of this Regulation is to improve the functioning of the internal market by laying down a uniform legal framework in particular for the development, placing on the

1	OJ C […], […], p. […].
2	Reference to ECB opinion.
3	OJ C […], […], p. […].
 
market, putting into service and the use of artificial intelligence systems in the Union in conformity with Union values, to promote the uptake of human centric and trustworthy artificial intelligence while ensuring a high level of protection of health, safety, fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter, including democracy and rule of law and environmental protection, against harmful effects of artificial intelligence systems in the Union and to support innovation. This regulation ensures the free movement of AI-based goods and services cross-border, thus preventing Member States from imposing restrictions on the development, marketing and use of Artificial Intelligence systems (AI systems), unless explicitly authorised by this Regulation.
(1a)	This Regulation should be applied in conformity with the values of the Union enshrined in the Charter facilitating the protection of individuals, companies, democracy and rule of law and the environment while boosting innovation and employment and making the Union a leader in the uptake of trustworthy AI.
(2)	AI systems can be easily deployed in multiple sectors of the economy and society, including cross border, and circulate throughout the Union. Certain Member States have already explored the adoption of national rules to ensure that artificial intelligence is trustworthy and safe and is developed and used in compliance with fundamental rights obligations. Differing national rules may lead to fragmentation of the internal market and decrease legal certainty for operators that develop, import or use AI systems. A consistent and high level of protection throughout the Union should therefore be ensured in order to achieve trustworthy AI, while divergences hampering the free circulation, innovation, deployment and uptake of AI systems and related products and services within the internal market should be prevented, by laying down uniform obligations for operators and guaranteeing the uniform protection of overriding reasons of public interest and of rights of persons throughout the internal market based on Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). To the extent that this Regulation contains specific rules on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data concerning restrictions of the use of AI systems for remote biometric identification for the purpose of law enforcement, for the use of AI systems for risk assessments of natural persons for the purpose of law enforcement and for the use of AI systems of biometric categorization for the purpose of law enforcement, it is appropriate to base this Regulation, in as far as those specific rules are concerned, on Article 16 of the TFEU. In light of those
 
specific rules and the recourse to Article 16 TFEU, it is appropriate to consult the European Data Protection Board.
(3)	Artificial intelligence is a fast evolving family of technologies that contributes to a wide array of economic, environmental and societal benefits across the entire spectrum of industries and social activities. By improving prediction, optimising operations and resource allocation, and personalising digital solutions available for individuals and organisations, the use of artificial intelligence can provide key competitive advantages to companies and support socially and environmentally beneficial outcomes, for example in healthcare, farming, food safety, education and training, media, sports, culture, infrastructure management, energy, transport and logistics, public services, security, justice, resource and energy efficiency, environmental monitoring, the conservation and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems and climate change mitigation and adaptation.
(4)	At the same time, depending on the circumstances regarding its specific application, use, and level of technological development, artificial intelligence may generate risks and cause harm to public interests and fundamental rights that are protected by Union law. Such harm might be material or immaterial, including physical, psychological, societal or economic harm.
(4a)	Given the major impact that artificial intelligence can have on society and the need to build trust, it is vital for artificial intelligence and its regulatory framework to be developed according to Union values enshrined in Article 2 TEU, the fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined in the Treaties, the Charter. As a pre-requisite, artificial intelligence should be a human-centric technology. It should serve as a tool for people, with the ultimate aim of increasing human well-being.
(4aa)	In order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of public interests as regards health, safety and fundamental rights, common rules for all high-risk AI systems should be established. Those rules should be consistent with the Charter of fundamental rights of the European Union (the Charter) and should be non-discriminatory and in line with the Union’s international trade commitments. They should also take into account the European Declaration on Digital Rights and Principles for the Digital Decade (2023/C 23/01) and the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) of the High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence.
 
(5)	A Union legal framework laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence is therefore needed to foster the development, use and uptake of artificial intelligence in the internal market that at the same time meets a high level of protection of public interests, such as health and safety and the protection of fundamental rights, including democracy, rule of law and environmental protection as recognised and protected by Union law. To achieve that objective, rules regulating the placing on the market, putting into service and use of certain AI systems should be laid down, thus ensuring the smooth functioning of the internal market and allowing those systems to benefit from the principle of free movement of goods and services. These rules should be clear and robust in protecting fundamental rights, supportive of new innovative solutions, enabling to a European ecosystem of public and private actors creating AI systems in line with Union values and unlocking the potential of the digital transformation across all regions of the Union. By laying down those rules as well as measures in support of innovation with a particular focus on SMEs including startups, this Regulation supports the objective of promoting the European human-centric approach to AI and being a global leader in the development of secure, trustworthy and ethical artificial intelligence as stated by the European Council4, and it ensures the protection of ethical principles, as specifically requested by the the European Parliament5.
(5a)	The harmonised rules on the placing on the market, putting into service and use of AI systems laid down in this Regulation should apply across sectors and, in line with its New Legislative Framework approach, should be without prejudice to existing Union law, notably on data protection, consumer protection, fundamental rights, employment, and protection of workers, and product safety, to which this Regulation is complementary. As a consequence all rights and remedies provided for by such Union law to consumers, and other persons who may be negatively impacted by AI systems, including as regards the compensation of possible damages pursuant to Council Directive 85/374/EEC of 25 July 1985 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning liability for defective products, remain unaffected and fully applicable. Furthermore, in the context of employment and protection of workers, this Regulation should therefore not affect Union law on social policy and national labour law, in compliance with Union law, concerning employment and working conditions, including

4		European Council, Special meeting of the European Council (1 and 2 October 2020) – Conclusions, EUCO 13/20, 2020, p. 6.
5	European Parliament resolution of 20 October 2020 with recommendations to the Commission on a framework of ethical aspects of artificial intelligence, robotics and related technologies, 2020/2012(INL).
 
health and safety at work and the relationship between employers and workers. This Regulation should also not affect the exercise of fundamental rights as recognised in the Member States and at Union level, including the right or freedom to strike or to take other action covered by the specific industrial relations systems in Member States as well as, the right to negotiate, to conclude and enforce collective agreements or to take collective action in accordance with national law. [This Regulation should not affect the provisions aiming to improve working conditions in platform work set out in Directive ... [COD 2021/414/EC]] On top of that, this Regulation aims to strengthen the effectiveness of such existing rights and remedies by establishing specific requirements and obligations, including in respect of transparency, technical documentation and record-keeping of AI systems. Furthermore, the obligations placed on various operators involved in the AI value chain under this Regulation should apply without prejudice to national laws, in compliance with Union law, having the effect of limiting the use of certain AI systems where such laws fall outside the scope of this Regulation or pursue other legitimate public interest objectives than those pursued by this Regulation. For example, national labour law and the laws on the protection of minors (i.e. persons below the age of 18) taking into account the United Nations General Comment No 25 (2021) on children’s rights, insofar as they are not specific to AI systems and pursue other legitimate public interest objectives, should not be affected by this Regulation.
(5aa)	The fundamental right to the protection of personal data is safeguarded in particular by Regulations (EU) 2016/679 and (EU) 2018/1725 and Directive 2016/680. Directive 2002/58/EC additionally protects private life and the confidentiality of communications, including by way of providing conditions for any personal and non-personal data storing in and access from terminal equipment. Those Union legal acts provide the basis for sustainable and responsible data processing, including where datasets include a mix of personal and non-personal data. This Regulation does not seek to affect the application of existing Union law governing the processing of personal data, including the tasks and powers of the independent supervisory authorities competent to monitor compliance with those instruments. It also does not affect the obligations of providers and deployers of AI systems in their role as data controllers or processors stemming from national or Union law on the protection of personal data in so far as the design, the development or the use of AI systems involves the processing of personal data. It is also appropriate to clarify that data subjects continue to enjoy all the rights and guarantees awarded to them by such Union law, including the rights related to solely automated individual decision-making, including
 
profiling. Harmonised rules for the placing on the market, the putting into service and the use of AI systems established under this Regulation should facilitate the effective
implementation and enable the exercise of the data subjects’ rights and other remedies guaranteed under Union law on the protection of personal data and of other fundamental rights.
(5ab)	This Regulation should be without prejudice to the provisions regarding the liability of intermediary service providers set out in Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council [as amended by the Digital Services Act].
(6)	The notion of AI system in this Regulation should be clearly defined and closely aligned with the work of international organisations working on artificial intelligence to ensure legal certainty, facilitate international convergence and wide acceptance, while providing the flexibility to accommodate the rapid technological developments in this field. Moreover, it should be based on key characteristics of artificial intelligence systems, that distinguish it from simpler traditional software systems or programming approaches and should not cover systems that are based on the rules defined solely by natural persons to automatically execute operations. A key characteristic of AI systems is their capability to infer. This inference refers to the process of obtaining the outputs, such as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions, which can influence physical and virtual environments and to a capability of AI systems to derive models and/or algorithms from inputs/data. The techniques that enable inference while building an AI system include machine learning approaches that learn from data how to achieve certain objectives; and logic- and knowledge-based approaches that infer from encoded knowledge or symbolic representation of the task to be solved. The capacity of an AI system to infer goes beyond basic data processing, enable learning, reasoning or modelling. The term “machine-based” refers to the fact that AI systems run on machines. The reference to explicit or implicit objectives underscores that AI systems can operate according to explicit defined objectives or to implicit objectives. The objectives of the AI system may be different from the intended purpose of the AI system in a specific context. For the purposes of this Regulation, environments should be understood as the contexts in which the AI systems operate, whereas outputs generated by the AI system, reflect different functions performed by AI systems and include predictions, content, recommendations or decisions. AI systems are designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy, meaning that they have some degree of independence of actions from human involvement and of capabilities to
 
operate without human intervention. The adaptiveness that an AI system could exhibit after deployment, refers to self-learning capabilities, allowing the system to change while in use. AI systems can be used on a stand-alone basis or as a component of a product, irrespective of whether the system is physically integrated into the product (embedded) or serve the functionality of the product without being integrated therein (non-embedded).
(6a)	The notion of ‘deployer’ referred to in this Regulation should be interpreted as any natural or legal person, including a public authority, agency or other body, using an AI system under its authority, except where the AI system is used in the course of a personal non- professional activity. Depending on the type of AI system, the use of the system may affect persons other than the deployer.
(7)	The notion of biometric data used in this Regulation should be interpreted in light of the notion of biometric data as defined in Article 4(14) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council 6, Article 3(18) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council 7 and Article 3(13) of Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council 8.Biometric data can allow for the authentication, identification or categorisation of natural persons and for the recognition of emotions of natural persons.
(7a)  The notion of biometric identification as used in this Regulation should be defined as the automated recognition of physical, physiological and behavioural human features such as the face, eye movement, body shape, voice, prosody, gait, posture, heart rate, blood
pressure, odour, keystrokes characteristics, for the purpose of establishing an individual’s identity by comparing biometric data of that individual to stored biometric data of individuals in a reference database, irrespective of whether the individual has given its consent or not.

person is the person he or she claims to be and to confirm the identity of a natural person for the sole purpose of having access to a service, unlocking a device or having security access to premises.
(7b)	The notion of biometric categorisation as used in this Regulation should be defined as assigning natural persons to specific categories on the basis of their biometric data. Such specific categories can relate to aspects such as sex, age, hair colour, eye colour, tattoos, behavioural or personality traits, language, religion, membership of a national minority, sexual or political orientation. This does not include biometric categorization systems that are a purely ancillary feature intrinsically linked to another commercial service meaning that the feature cannot, for objective technical reasons, be used without the principal service and the integration of that feature or functionality is not a means to circumvent the applicability of the rules of this Regulation. For example, filters categorizing facial or body features used on online marketplaces could constitute such an ancillary feature as they can only be used in relation to the principal service which consists in selling a product by allowing the consumer to preview the display of the product on him or herself and help the consumer to make a purchase decision. Filters used on online social network services which categorise facial or body features to allow users to add or modify pictures or videos could also be considered as ancillary feature as such filter cannot be used without the principal service of the social network services consisting in the sharing of content online.
(8)	The notion of remote biometric identification system as used in this Regulation should be defined functionally, as an AI system intended for the identification of natural persons without their active involvement, typically at a distance, through the comparison of a
person’s biometric data with the biometric data contained in a reference database, irrespectively of the particular technology, processes or types of biometric data used. Such remote biometric identification systems are typically used to perceive multiple persons or their behaviour simultaneously in order to facilitate significantly the identification of natural persons without their active involvement. This excludes AI systems intended to be used for biometric verification, which includes authentication, whose sole purpose is to confirm that a specific natural person is the person he or she claims to be and to confirm the identity of a natural person for the sole purpose of having access to a service, unlocking a device or having security access to premises. This exclusion is justified by the fact that such systems are likely to have a minor impact on fundamental rights of natural persons compared to the remote biometric identification systems which may be used for the
 
processing of the biometric data of a large number of persons without their active
involvement. In the case of ‘real-time’ systems, the capturing of the biometric data, the comparison and the identification occur all instantaneously, near-instantaneously or in any event without a significant delay. In this regard, there should be no scope for
circumventing the rules of this Regulation on the ‘real-time’ use of the AI systems in
question by providing for minor delays. ‘Real-time’ systems involve the use of ‘live’ or ‘near-‘live’ material, such as video footage, generated by a camera or other device with similar functionality. In the case of ‘post’ systems, in contrast, the biometric data have
already been captured and the comparison and identification occur only after a significant delay. This involves material, such as pictures or video footage generated by closed circuit television cameras or private devices, which has been generated before the use of the system in respect of the natural persons concerned.
(8a)	The notion of emotion recognition system for the purpose of this regulation should be defined as an AI system for the purpose of identifying or inferring emotions or intentions of natural persons on the basis of their biometric data. This refers to emotions or intentions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, disgust, embarrassment, excitement, shame, contempt, satisfaction and amusement. It does not include physical states, such as pain or fatigue. It does not refer for example to systems used in detecting the state of fatigue of professional pilots or drivers for the purpose of preventing accidents. It does also not include the mere detection of readily apparent expressions, gestures or movements, unless they are used for identifying or inferring emotions. These expressions can be basic facial expressions such as a frown or a smile, or gestures such as the movement of hands, arms or head, or characteristics of a person’s voice, for example a raised voice or whispering.
(9)	For the purposes of this Regulation the notion of publicly accessible space should be understood as referring to any physical place that is accessible to an undetermined number of natural persons, and irrespective of whether the place in question is privately or publicly owned and irrespective of the activity for which the place may be used, such as commerce (for instance, shops, restaurants, cafés), services (for instance, banks, professional activities, hospitality), sport (for instance, swimming pools, gyms, stadiums), transport (for instance, bus, metro and railway stations, airports, means of transport ), entertainment (for instance, cinemas, theatres, museums, concert and conference halls) leisure or otherwise (for instance, public roads and squares, parks, forests, playgrounds). A place should be classified as publicly accessible also if, regardless of potential capacity or security
 
restrictions, access is subject to certain predetermined conditions, which can be fulfilled by an undetermined number of persons, such as purchase of a ticket or title of transport, prior registration or having a certain age. By contrast, a place should not be considered publicly accessible if access is limited to specific and defined natural persons through either Union or national law directly related to public safety or security or through the clear manifestation of will by the person having the relevant authority on the place. The factual possibility of access alone (e.g. an unlocked door, an open gate in a fence) does not imply that the place is publicly accessible in the presence of indications or circumstances suggesting the contrary (e.g. signs prohibiting or restricting access). Company and factory premises as well as offices and workplaces that are intended to be accessed only by relevant employees and service providers are places that are not publicly accessible.
Publicly accessible spaces should not include prisons or border control. Some other areas may be composed of both not publicly accessible and publicly accessible areas, such as the hallway of a private residential building necessary to access a doctor's office or an airport. Online spaces are not covered either, as they are not physical spaces. Whether a given space is accessible to the public should however be determined on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the specificities of the individual situation at hand.
(9b)	In order to obtain the greatest benefits from AI systems while protecting fundamental rights, health and safety and to enable democratic control, AI literacy should equip providers, deployers and affected persons with the necessary notions to make informed decisions regarding AI systems. These notions may vary with regard to the relevant context and can include understanding the correct application of technical elements during the AI system’s development phase, the measures to be applied during its use, the suitable ways in which to interpret the AI system’s output, and, in the case of affected persons, the knowledge necessary to understand how decisions taken with the assistance of AI will impact them. In the context of the application this Regulation, AI literacy should provide all relevant actors in the AI value chain with the insights required to ensure the appropriate compliance and its correct enforcement. Furthermore, the wide implementation of AI literacy measures and the introduction of appropriate follow-up actions could contribute to improving working conditions and ultimately sustain the consolidation, and innovation path of trustworthy AI in the Union. The European Artificial Intelligence Board should support the Commission, to promote AI literacy tools, public awareness and understanding of the benefits, risks, safeguards, rights and obligations in relation to the use of AI systems. In cooperation with the relevant stakeholders, the Commission and the Member States
 
should facilitate the drawing up of voluntary codes of conduct to advance AI literacy among persons dealing with the development, operation and use of AI.
(10)	In order to ensure a level playing field and an effective protection of rights and freedoms of individuals across the Union, the rules established by this Regulation should apply to providers of AI systems in a non-discriminatory manner, irrespective of whether they are established within the Union or in a third country, and to deployers of AI systems established within the Union.
(11)	In light of their digital nature, certain AI systems should fall within the scope of this Regulation even when they are neither placed on the market, nor put into service, nor used in the Union. This is the case for example of an operator established in the Union that contracts certain services to an operator established outside the Union in relation to an activity to be performed by an AI system that would qualify as high-risk. In those circumstances, the AI system used by the operator outside the Union could process data lawfully collected in and transferred from the Union, and provide to the contracting operator in the Union the output of that AI system resulting from that processing, without that AI system being placed on the market, put into service or used in the Union. To prevent the circumvention of this Regulation and to ensure an effective protection of natural persons located in the Union, this Regulation should also apply to providers and deployers of AI systems that are established in a third country, to the extent the output produced by those systems is intended to be used in the Union. Nonetheless, to take into account existing arrangements and special needs for future cooperation with foreign partners with whom information and evidence is exchanged, this Regulation should not apply to public authorities of a third country and international organisations when acting in the framework of cooperation or international agreements concluded at national or European level for law enforcement and judicial cooperation with the Union or with its Member States, under the condition that this third country or international organisations provide adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals. Where relevant, this may also cover activities of entities entrusted by the third countries to carry out specific tasks in support of such law enforcement and judicial cooperation. Such framework for cooperation or agreements have been established bilaterally between Member States and third countries or between the European Union, Europol and other EU agencies and third countries and international organisations. The authorities competent for supervision of the law enforcement and judicial authorities under
 
the AI Act should assess whether these frameworks for cooperation or international agreements include adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals. Recipient Member States authorities and Union institutions, offices and bodies making use of such outputs in the Union remain accountable to ensure their use complies with Union law. When those international agreements are revised or new ones are concluded in the future, the contracting parties should undertake the utmost effort to align those agreements with the requirements of this Regulation.
(12)	This Regulation should also apply to Union institutions, offices, bodies and agencies when acting as a provider or deployer of an AI system.
(12a)	If and insofar AI systems are placed on the market, put into service, or used with or without modification of such systems for military, defence or national security purposes, those should be excluded from the scope of this Regulation regardless of which type of entity is carrying out those activities, such as whether it is a public or private entity. As regards military and defence purposes, such exclusion is justified both by Article 4(2) TEU and by the specificities of the Member States’ and the common Union defence policy covered by Chapter 2 of Title V of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) that are subject to public international law, which is therefore the more appropriate legal framework for the regulation of AI systems in the context of the use of lethal force and other AI systems in the context of military and defence activities. As regards national security purposes, the exclusion is justified both by the fact that national security remains the sole responsibility of Member States in accordance with Article 4(2) TEU and by the specific nature and operational needs of national security activities and specific national rules applicable to those activities. Nonetheless, if an AI system developed, placed on the market, put into service or used for military, defence or national security purposes is used outside those temporarily or permanently for other purposes (for example, civilian or humanitarian purposes, law enforcement or public security purposes), such a system would fall within the scope of this Regulation. In that case, the entity using the system for other than military, defence or national security purposes should ensure compliance of the system with this Regulation, unless the system is already compliant with this Regulation. AI systems placed on the market or put into service for an excluded (i.e. military, defence or national security) and one or more non excluded purposes (e.g. civilian purposes, law enforcement, etc.), fall within the scope of this Regulation and providers of those systems
 
should ensure compliance with this Regulation. In those cases, the fact that an AI system may fall within the scope of this Regulation should not affect the possibility of entities carrying out national security, defence and military activities, regardless of the type of entity carrying out those activities, to use AI systems for national security, military and defence purposes, the use of which is excluded from the scope of this Regulation. An AI system placed on the market for civilian or law enforcement purposes which is used with or without modification for military, defence or national security purposes should not fall within the scope of this Regulation, regardless of the type of entity carrying out those activities.
(12c)	This Regulation should support innovation, respect freedom of science, and should not undermine research and development activity. It is therefore necessary to exclude from its scope AI systems and models specifically developed and put into service for the sole purpose of scientific research and development. Moreover, it is necessary to ensure that the Regulation does not otherwise affect scientific research and development activity on AI systems or models prior to being placed on the market or put into service. As regards product oriented research, testing and development activity regarding AI systems or models, the provisions of this Regulation should also not apply prior to these systems and models being put into service or placed on the market. This is without prejudice to the obligation to comply with this Regulation when an AI system falling into the scope of this Regulation is placed on the market or put into service as a result of such research and development activity and to the application of provisions on regulatory sandboxes and testing in real world conditions. Furthermore, without prejudice to the foregoing regarding AI systems specifically developed and put into service for the sole purpose of scientific research and development, any other AI system that may be used for the conduct of any research and development activity should remain subject to the provisions of this Regulation. Under all circumstances, any research and development activity should be carried out in accordance with recognised ethical and professional standards for scientific research and should be conducted according to applicable Union law.
(14)	In order to introduce a proportionate and effective set of binding rules for AI systems, a clearly defined risk-based approach should be followed. That approach should tailor the type and content of such rules to the intensity and scope of the risks that AI systems can generate. It is therefore necessary to prohibit certain unacceptable artificial intelligence
 
practices, to lay down requirements for high-risk AI systems and obligations for the relevant operators, and to lay down transparency obligations for certain AI systems.
(14a)	While the risk-based approach is the basis for a proportionate and effective set of binding rules, it is important to recall the 2019 Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI developed by the independent High-Level Expert Group on AI (HLEG) appointed by the Commission. In those Guidelines the HLEG developed seven non-binding ethical principles for AI which should help ensure that AI is trustworthy and ethically sound. The seven principles include: human agency and oversight; technical robustness and safety; privacy and data governance; transparency; diversity, non-discrimination and fairness; societal and environmental well-being and accountability. Without prejudice to the legally binding requirements of this Regulation and any other applicable Union law, these Guidelines contribute to the design of a coherent, trustworthy and human-centric Artificial Intelligence, in line with the Charter and with the values on which the Union is founded. According to the Guidelines of HLEG, human agency and oversight means that AI systems are developed and used as a tool that serves people, respects human dignity and personal autonomy, and that is functioning in a way that can be appropriately controlled and overseen by humans. Technical robustness and safety means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that allows robustness in case of problems and resilience against attempts to alter the use or performance of the AI system so as to allow unlawful use by third parties, and minimise unintended harm. Privacy and data governance means that AI systems are developed and used in compliance with existing privacy and data protection rules, while processing data that meets high standards in terms of quality and integrity.
Transparency means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that allows appropriate traceability and explainability, while making humans aware that they communicate or interact with an AI system, as well as duly informing deployers of the capabilities and limitations of that AI system and affected persons about their rights.
Diversity, non-discrimination and fairness means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that includes diverse actors and promotes equal access, gender equality and cultural diversity, while avoiding discriminatory impacts and unfair biases that are prohibited by Union or national law. Social and environmental well-being means that AI systems are developed and used in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner as well as in a way to benefit all human beings, while monitoring and assessing the long-term impacts on the individual, society and democracy. The application of these principles should be translated, when possible, in the design and use of AI models. They should in
 
any case serve as a basis for the drafting of codes of conduct under this Regulation. All stakeholders, including industry, academia, civil society and standardisation organisations, are encouraged to take into account as appropriate the ethical principles for the development of voluntary best practices and standards.
(15)	Aside from the many beneficial uses of artificial intelligence, that technology can also be misused and provide novel and powerful tools for manipulative, exploitative and social control practices. Such practices are particularly harmful and abusive and should be prohibited because they contradict Union values of respect for human dignity, freedom, equality, democracy and the rule of law and Union fundamental rights, including the right to non-discrimination, data protection and privacy and the rights of the child.
(16)	AI-enabled manipulative techniques can be used to persuade persons to engage in unwanted behaviours, or to deceive them by nudging them into decisions in a way that subverts and impairs their autonomy, decision-making and free choices. The placing on the market, putting into service or use of certain AI systems with the objective to or the effect of materially distorting human behaviour, whereby significant harms, in particular having sufficiently important adverse impacts on physical, psychological health or financial interests are likely to occur, are particularly dangerous and should therefore be forbidden. Such AI systems deploy subliminal components such as audio, image, video stimuli that persons cannot perceive as those stimuli are beyond human perception or other
manipulative or deceptive techniques that subvert or impair person’s autonomy, decision- making or free choices in ways that people are not consciously aware of, or even if aware they are still deceived or not able to control or resist. This could be for example, facilitated by machine-brain interfaces or virtual reality as they allow for a higher degree of control of what stimuli are presented to persons, insofar as they may be materially distorting their behaviour in a significantly harmful manner. In addition, AI systems may also otherwise exploit vulnerabilities of a person or a specific group of persons due to their age, disability within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2019/882, or a specific social or economic situation that is likely to make those persons more vulnerable to exploitation such as persons living in extreme poverty, ethnic or religious minorities. Such AI systems can be placed on the market, put into service or used with the objective to or the effect of materially distorting the behaviour of a person and in a manner that causes or is reasonably likely to cause significant harm to that or another person or groups of persons, including harms that may be accumulated over time and should therefore be prohibited. The intention to distort the
 
behaviour may not be presumed if the distortion results from factors external to the AI system which are outside of the control of the provider or the deployer, meaning factors that may not be reasonably foreseen and mitigated by the provider or the deployer of the AI system. In any case, it is not necessary for the provider or the deployer to have the intention to cause significant harm, as long as such harm results from the manipulative or exploitative AI-enabled practices. The prohibitions for such AI practices are complementary to the provisions contained in Directive 2005/29/EC, notably unfair commercial practices leading to economic or financial harms to consumers are prohibited under all circumstances, irrespective of whether they are put in place through AI systems or otherwise. The prohibitions of manipulative and exploitative practices in this Regulation should not affect lawful practices in the context of medical treatment such as psychological treatment of a mental disease or physical rehabilitation, when those practices are carried out in accordance with the applicable legislation and medical standards, for example explicit consent of the individuals or their legal representatives. In addition, common and legitimate commercial practices, for example in the field of advertising, that are in compliance with the applicable law should not in themselves be regarded as constituting harmful manipulative AI practices.
(16a)	Biometric categorisation systems that are based on individuals’ biometric data, such as an
individual person’s face or fingerprint, to deduce or infer an individuals’ political opinions, trade union membership, religious or philosophical beliefs, race, sex life or sexual orientation should be prohibited. This prohibition does not cover the lawful labelling, filtering or categorisation of biometric datasets acquired in line with Union or national law according to biometric data, such as the sorting of images according to hair colour or eye colour, which can for example be used in the area of law enforcement.
(17)	AI systems providing social scoring of natural persons by public or private actors may lead to discriminatory outcomes and the exclusion of certain groups. They may violate the right to dignity and non-discrimination and the values of equality and justice. Such AI systems evaluate or classify natural persons or groups thereof based on multiple data points related to their social behaviour in multiple contexts or known, inferred or predicted personal or personality characteristics over certain periods of time. The social score obtained from such AI systems may lead to the detrimental or unfavourable treatment of natural persons or whole groups thereof in social contexts, which are unrelated to the context in which the data was originally generated or collected or to a detrimental treatment that is
 
disproportionate or unjustified to the gravity of their social behaviour. AI systems entailing such unacceptable scoring practices leading to such detrimental or unfavourable outcomes should be therefore prohibited. This prohibition should not affect lawful evaluation practices of natural persons done for a specific purpose in compliance with national and Union law.
(18)	The use of AI systems for ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification of natural persons in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement is particularly intrusive to the rights and freedoms of the concerned persons, to the extent that it may affect the private life of a large part of the population, evoke a feeling of constant surveillance and indirectly dissuade the exercise of the freedom of assembly and other fundamental rights. Technical inaccuracies of AI systems intended for the remote biometric identification of natural persons can lead to biased results and entail discriminatory effects. This is particularly relevant when it comes to age, ethnicity, race, sex or disabilities. In addition, the immediacy of the impact and the limited opportunities for further checks or corrections in relation to the use of such systems operating in ‘real-time’ carry heightened risks for the rights and freedoms of the persons that are concerned by law enforcement activities.
(19)	The use of those systems for the purpose of law enforcement should therefore be prohibited, except in exhaustively listed and narrowly defined situations, where the use is strictly necessary to achieve a substantial public interest, the importance of which outweighs the risks. Those situations involve the search for certain victims of crime including missing people; certain threats to the life or physical safety of natural persons or of a terrorist attack; and the localisation or identification of perpetrators or suspects of the criminal offences referred to in Annex IIa if those criminal offences are punishable in the Member State concerned by a custodial sentence or a detention order for a maximum period of at least four years and as they are defined in the law of that Member State. Such threshold for the custodial sentence or detention order in accordance with national law contributes to ensure that the offence should be serious enough to potentially justify the use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems. Moreover, the list of criminal offences as referred in Annex IIa is based on the 32 criminal offences listed in the Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA9, taking into account that some are in practice likely to be more relevant than others, in that the recourse to ‘real-time’ remote biometric

9	Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA of 13 June 2002 on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States (OJ L 190, 18.7.2002, p. 1).
 
identification will foreseeably be necessary and proportionate to highly varying degrees for the practical pursuit of the localisation or identification of a perpetrator or suspect of the different criminal offences listed and having regard to the likely differences in the seriousness, probability and scale of the harm or possible negative consequences.
An imminent threat to life or physical safety of natural persons could also result from a serious disruption of critical infrastructure, as defined in Article 2, point (a) of Directive 2008/114/EC, where the disruption or destruction of such critical infrastructure would result in an imminent threat to life or physical safety of a person, including through serious harm to the provision of basic supplies to the population or to the exercise of the core function of the State.
In addition, this Regulation should preserve the ability for law enforcement, border control, immigration or asylum authorities to carry out identity checks in the presence of the person that is concerned in accordance with the conditions set out in Union and national law for such checks. In particular, law enforcement, border control, immigration or asylum authorities should be able to use information systems, in accordance with Union or national law, to identify a person who, during an identity check, either refuses to be identified or is unable to state or prove his or her identity, without being required by this Regulation to obtain prior authorisation. This could be, for example, a person involved in a crime, being unwilling, or unable due to an accident or a medical condition, to disclose their identity to law enforcement authorities.
(20)	In order to ensure that those systems are used in a responsible and proportionate manner, it is also important to establish that, in each of those exhaustively listed and narrowly defined situations, certain elements should be taken into account, in particular as regards the nature of the situation giving rise to the request and the consequences of the use for the rights and freedoms of all persons concerned and the safeguards and conditions provided for with the use. In addition, the use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement should only be deployed to confirm the specifically target individual’s identity and should be limited to what is strictly necessary concerning the period of time as well as geographic and personal scope, having regard in particular to the evidence or indications regarding the threats, the victims or perpetrator. The use of the ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification system in publicly accessible spaces should only be authorised if the law enforcement authority has completed a fundamental rights impact assessment and, unless provided otherwise in this Regulation, has registered the system in the database as set out in this Regulation. The reference
 
database of persons should be appropriate for each use case in each of the situations mentioned above.
(21)	Each use of a ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification system in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement should be subject to an express and specific authorisation by a judicial authority or by an independent administrative authority whose decision is binding of a Member State. Such authorisation should in principle be obtained prior to the use of the system with a view to identify a person or persons. Exceptions to this rule should be allowed in duly justified situations of urgency, that is, situations where the need to use the systems in question is such as to make it effectively and objectively impossible to obtain an authorisation before commencing the use. In such situations of urgency, the use should be restricted to the absolute minimum necessary and be subject to appropriate safeguards and conditions, as determined in national law and specified in the context of each individual urgent use case by the law enforcement authority itself. In addition, the law enforcement authority should in such situations request such authorisation whilst providing the reasons for not having been able to request it earlier, without undue delay and, at the latest within 24 hours. If such authorisation is rejected, the use of real-time biometric identification systems linked to that authorisation should be stopped with immediate effect and all the data related to such use should be discarded and deleted. Such data includes input data directly acquired by an AI system in the course of the use of such system as well as the results and outputs of the use linked to that authorisation. It should not include input legally acquired in accordance with another national or Union law. In any case, no decision producing an adverse legal effect on a person may be taken solely based on the output of the remote biometric identification system.
(21a)	In order to carry out their tasks in accordance with the requirements set out in this Regulation as well as in national rules, the relevant market surveillance authority and the
national data protection authority should be notified of each use of the ‘real-time biometric identification system’. National market surveillance authorities and the national data protection authorities that have been notified should submit to the Commission an annual
report on the use of ‘real-time biometric identification systems’.

(22)	Furthermore, it is appropriate to provide, within the exhaustive framework set by this Regulation that such use in the territory of a Member State in accordance with this
 
Regulation should only be possible where and in as far as the Member State in question has decided to expressly provide for the possibility to authorise such use in its detailed rules of national law. Consequently, Member States remain free under this Regulation not to provide for such a possibility at all or to only provide for such a possibility in respect of some of the objectives capable of justifying authorised use identified in this Regulation.
These national rules should be notified to the Commission at the latest 30 days following their adoption.
(23)	The use of AI systems for ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification of natural persons in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement necessarily involves the processing of biometric data. The rules of this Regulation that prohibit, subject to certain exceptions, such use, which are based on Article 16 TFEU, should apply as lex specialis in respect of the rules on the processing of biometric data contained in Article 10 of Directive (EU) 2016/680, thus regulating such use and the processing of biometric data involved in an exhaustive manner. Therefore, such use and processing should only be possible in as far as it is compatible with the framework set by this Regulation, without there being scope, outside that framework, for the competent authorities, where they act for purpose of law enforcement, to use such systems and process such data in connection thereto on the grounds listed in Article 10 of Directive (EU) 2016/680. In this context, this Regulation is not intended to provide the legal basis for the processing of personal data under Article 8 of Directive 2016/680. However, the use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for purposes other than law enforcement, including by competent authorities, should not be covered by the specific framework regarding such use for the purpose of law enforcement set by this Regulation. Such use for purposes other than law enforcement should therefore not be subject to the requirement of an authorisation under this Regulation and the applicable detailed rules of national law that may give effect to it.
(24)	Any processing of biometric data and other personal data involved in the use of AI systems for biometric identification, other than in connection to the use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement as regulated by this Regulation, should continue to comply with all requirements resulting from Article 10 of Directive (EU) 2016/680. For purposes other than law enforcement, Article 9(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Article 10(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 prohibit the processing of biometric data subject to limited

The sources are based on Service Interface Function (SIF) images of very dense regions in the sky. These sources build an add-on catalogue to the nominal Gaia catalogue. Nominal and SIF detections were not mixed to create these sources. These sources are thus obtained from SIF image detections only. Sources already present in the nominal catalogue were removed from the SIF add-on catalogue. The catalogue contains positions, parallaxes and proper motions for 526,457 new Gaia sources as derived from the SIF images (with 130 additional sources with positions only),\u00a0and photometric information (mean G magnitude and flux) for these same 526,587 sources as derived from the SIF images.\nSummary:\n|Period of observations?          |66 months of data         |\n|---------------------------------|--------------------------|\n|Complementary to Gaia DR3?       |Yes                       |\n|Reference epoch?                 |2017.5                    |\n|Gaia DR3 crossmatches applicable?|No, this is fully new data|\n|Gaia DR3 passbands applicable?   |Yes, Gaia DR3 G-band only |\n|Defined in the Gaia-CRF3 frame?  |Yes                       |\n|Gaia designation                 |Gaia FPR yyyy             |\nESASky displays the Gaia FPR Crowded Field Source catalogue (called crowded\\_field\\_source in the [Gaia archive](https://archives.esac.esa.int/gaia)).

They were selected from the public observations taken between 2000 February 1 and 2021 December 4 and overlap by at least one arcminute in radius and are not affected by very high background emission. The catalogue contains 386,043 unique sources, 298,626 of them multiply observed, with positions and source parameters like fluxes in the XMM-Newton standard energy bands, hardness ratios, quality estimate, and information on inter-observation variability.

The cross-matching process involves adjusting the relative astrometry of overlapping images so as to minimize positional offsets between closely aligned sources in different images. After correction, the astrometric residuals of cross-matched sources are significantly reduced, with median errors less than 8 mas. The absolute astrometry is calibrated using Gaia DR1, Pan-STARRS, SDSS, and 2MASS as the astrometric backbone for initial corrections. In addition, the catalog includes source nondetections. The cross-matching algorithms and the properties of the initial (Beta 0.1) catalog are described in [Budavari & Lubow (2012)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...761..188B), and the Version 1 catalog is described in [Whitmore et al.

It contains 1653 detection, of which 1203 are confirmed clusters with identified counterparts in external datasets.\nThe catalogue was constructed using three detection pipelines: two implementations of the matched multi-filter algorithm (MMF1 and MMF2) and a Bayesian algorithm called PowellSnakes (PwS). A union catalogue was constructed from the detections of all three pipelines. To avoid spurious detections due to foreground sources, a mask to remove Galactic dust, nearby galaxies and point sources was applied after the merging, leaving 83.7% of the sky.\nThe union catalogue contains the coordinates of a detection, its signal-to-noise ratio, an estimate of the total integrated Comptomization parameter Y and its uncertainty, as well as information on the generation and validation. If available, external identification of a cluster and its redshift is also provided. When more than one pipeline makes the same detection, the information is taken from the most significant detection. If the redshift is known, the SZ mass from the reference pipeline is provided.\nThe table below shows the columns from this catalogue displayed in\u00a0ESASky:\nPSZ2 default\u00a0columns displayed in ESASky\n|Column name              |Units         |Description                           |\n|-------------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------|\n|Name                     |-             |Source name                           |\n|Right Ascension\u00a0         |\u00a0hh mm ss.ss \u00a0|Right ascension of source (J2000)     |\n|Declination              |dd mm ss.s    |Declination of source (J2000)         |\n|Signal to noise          |-             |Signal-to-noise ratio of the detection|\n|Redshift                 |-             |Redshift of cluster                   |\n|Sundyaev-Zeldovitch mass\u00a0|1014\u00a0MSun     |Sundyaev-Zeldovitch mass proxy        |\n|Validation               |-             |External validation status            |", "meta": {"H1": "Catalogues - ESDC - Cosmos", "H2": "planck catalogues", "H3": "SECOND planck sunyaev-zeldovitch catalogue (Psz2)", "ID": "88"}, "questions": ["What is the release version of the SECOND Planck Sunyaev-Zeldovitch catalogue (Psz2)?", "What is the date range of the observations for the SECOND Planck Sunyaev-Zeldovitch catalogue (Psz2)?", "Where can the Planck SZ catalogue be found?", "How many detections are included in the Planck SZ catalogue?", "How was the Planck SZ catalogue constructed?", "What information is included in the union catalogue of the Planck SZ catalogue?", "What columns are displayed in ESASky for the PSZ2 default columns?"]}, {"context": "PLANCK CATALOGUE OF GALACTIC COLD CLUMPS (PGCC)\n*   Release: 2.0 (2015)\n*   Date of observations: from 13th August 2009 to 3rd August 2013\n*   Source:\u00a0[Planck Legacy Archive](http://pla.esac.esa.int/pla/#catalogues)\n*   Reference:\u00a0[Planck-2015-A37](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2016A&A...594A..28P/abstract)\nThe PGCC containes 13,188 Galactic sources and 54 sources located in the Magellanic Clouds, all of them identified as cold sources in Planck data (sources colder than their environment).

While verifying the capability of eROSITA to perform large-area uniform surveys and saving as a test and training dataset to establish calibration and data analysis procedures, the eFEDS survey also constitutes the largest contiguous soft X-ray survey at this depth to date, supporting a range of early eROSITA survey science investigations.\u00a0\nThe\u00a0Hard X-ray selected eFEDS catalogue contains\u00a0sources detected\u00a0in three bands (1: 0.2-0.6; 2: 0.6-2.3; 3: 2.3-5 keV) using eSASS adopting a detection likelihood threshold of 5.\u00a0The sources with a 2.3-5 keV band detection likelihood greater than 10 and a zero extent likelihood were selected\u00a0as the hard eFEDS catalogue (246 sources).\u00a0For more information see\u00a0[Brunner et. al. 2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A%26A...661A...1B/abstract).", "meta": {"H1": "Catalogues - ESDC - Cosmos", "H2": "CATALOGUES FROM OTHER DATA PROVIDERS", "H3": "eFEDS hard catalogue", "ID": "97"}, "questions": ["What is the release date of the eFEDS hard catalogue?", "When were the observations for the eFEDS hard catalogue conducted?", "What is the source of the eFEDS hard catalogue?", "What is the reference for the eFEDS hard catalogue?", "What is the purpose of the eFEDS survey?", "How many sources are included in the hard eFEDS catalogue?", "What are the energy ranges covered by the three bands in the eFEDS catalogue?", "What criteria were used to select sources for the hard eFEDS catalogue?", "How many sources are included in the hard eFEDS catalogue?", "Where can I find more information about the eFEDS hard catalogue?"]}, {"context": "eta Chamaeleontis main catalogue\n*   Release: EDR (2021)\n*   Date of observations: 16-18 November\u00a02019\n*   Source: [eROSITA EDR catalogues](https://erosita.mpe.mpg.de/edr/eROSITAObservations/Catalogues/)\n*   Reference: [Robrade et. al. 2022,\u00a0A&A, 661, 34](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A%26A...661A..34R/abstract)\nThe eta Cha main catalogue is a catalogue of X-ray sources in the eta\u00a0Chamaeleontis field scan observation (OBSID 300004).\u00a0The nearby young open cluster eta Chamaeleontis was\u00a0observed by eROSITA/SRG during its CalPV phase for 150 ks.

GLADE+ combines data from six separate but not independent astronomical catalogues: the GWGC, 2MPZ, 2MASS XSC, HyperLEDA, and WISExSCOSPZ galaxy catalogues, and the SDSS-DR16Q quasar catalogue. GLADE+ contains ~22.5 million galaxies and ~750,000 quasars. GLADE+ is complete up to a luminosity distance of ~44 Mpc in terms of the cumulative B-band luminosity of galaxies, and contains all of the brightest galaxies giving half of the total B-band luminosity up to ~95 Mpc. Considering the brightest galaxies giving half of the total luminosity in the W1-band, GLADE+ has nearly 90% completeness at even ~500 Mpc. Stellar masses and binary neutron star mergers for galaxies with W1 magnitudes have been derived. These parameters can help to rank the galaxies in a given gravitational wave localization volume, thereby possibly reducing the number of pointings and the total integration time needed to find the electromagnetic counterpart.\u00a0The codes used for the stellar mass and and merger rate calculations can be found on\u00a0[Github](https://github.com/MariaPalfi/Stellar_masses_for_GLADE).\u00a0For more information see [D\u00e1lya et. al.

It is a special reflecting Schmidt telescope with 4000 fibers in a field of view of 20 degrees. The LAMOST survey provides flux - and wavelength-calibrated, sky-subtracted spectra in the wavelength range of 3700-9000 angstrom for many types of astronomical objects. Since October 2018, LAMOST started the second stage survey program containing both low- and medium-resolution spectroscopic surveys, and the medium-resolution spectroscopic survey includes two surveys, i.e., the time-domain and the non time-domain surveys.\nThe eighth LAMOST data release (LAMOST DR8) includes observations until June 2020. The Low-Resolution spectroscopic survey (LRS) General Catalog contains 10,633,515 spectra, of which 10,336,752 are stars, 224,702 are galaxies, 72,061 are QSOs, and there are 9,563,115 spectra with g-band SNR or i-band SNR larger than 10. The Medium-Resolution spectroscopic survey (MRS) General Catalog contains 5,975,982 spectra, where there are 1,465,789 and 4,510,193 spectra for the non time-domain and time-domain surveys, respectively. (Note: This catalog contains in total 22,141,635 entries, which is different from the two statistics numbers above. For the number of the non-time-domain survey, we only count each of the coadded spectra as one of the 1,465,789 spectra, while for the time-domain survey, every single exposure of the B band plus R band were regarded as one of the 4,510,193 spectra.)\nThe following columns have been included in _ESASky_:\nLAMOST LRS General Catalogue default columns in\u00a0ESASky\n|Column name   |Units       |Description                              |\n|--------------|------------|-----------------------------------------|\n|Name          |-           |Target name                              |\n|RA (J2000)    |hh mm ss.ss\u00a0|Right ascension of fiber pointing (J2000)|\n|Dec (J2000)   |dd mm ss.s  |Declination of fiber pointing (J2000)    |\n|Observation ID|-           |Observation ID                           |\n|obsDate       |yyyy-mm-dd  |Target Observation Date                  |\n|Class         |-           |Stellar spectral type                    |\n|Subclass      |-           |Stellar subclass                         |\n|Z             |-           |Redshift                                 |\n|Z Error       |-           |Redshift uncertainty                     |\n|SNR U         |-           |Signal-to-noise ratio of u filter        |\n|SNR G         |-           |Signal-to-noise ratio of g filter        |\n|SNR R         |-           |Signal-to-noise ratio of r filter        |\n|SNR I         |-           |Signal-to-noise ratio of i filter        |\n|SNR Z         |-           |Signal-to-noise ratio of z filter        |\n|Mag Type      |-           |Target magnitude type                    |\n|Mag 1         |mag         |Associated magnitude 1                   |\n|Mag 2         |mag         |Associated magnitude 2                   |\n|Mag 3         |mag         |Associated magnitude 3                   |\n|Mag 4         |mag         |Associated magnitude 4                   |\n|Mag 5         |mag         |Associated magnitude 5                   |\n|Mag 6         |mag         |Associated magnitude 6                   |\n|Mag 7         |mag         |Associated magnitude 7                   |\nLAMOST MRS General Catalogue default columns in ESASky\n* Column name: Name\n  * Units: -\n  * Description: Target name\n* Column name: RA (J2000)\n  * Units: hh mm ss.ss\u00a0\n  * Description: Right ascension of fiber pointing (J2000)\n* Column name: Dec (J2000)\n  * Units: dd mm ss.s\n  * Description: Declination of fiber pointing (J2000)\n* Column name: Observation ID\n  * Units: -\n  * Description: Observation ID\n* Column name: obsDate\n  * Units: yyyy-mm-dd\n  * Description: Target Observation Date\n* Column name: Band\n  * Units: -\n  * Description: Having two values of B and R, which represent B and R band spectra\n* Column name: snr\n  * Units: -\n  * Description: The median value of all pixel S/Ns in B band spectrum or R band\n* Column name: Radial Velocity R band\n  * Units: km/s\n  * Description: Radial velocity of R band spectra measured with 483 selected KURUCZ synthetic templates\n* Column name: Radial Velocity B band\n  * Units: km/s\n  * Description: Radial velocity of B band spectra measured with 483 selected KURUCZ synthetic templates\nIn addition to the LRS and MRS General Catalogs, LAMOST DR8 provides many other catalogs, including stellar parameter catalogs, the Observed Plate Information Catalog, the Input Catalog and others.

Further improved catalogues were made available to the science community later. This Galaxy charter mission has produced four major catalogues referred to as the Hipparcos-1 Catalogue, the Tycho-1 Catalogue, the Hipparcos-2 Catalogue, and the Tycho-2 Catalogue.\nThese are the 42\u00a0Hipparcos data products (catalogues and annexes) currently available via the [ESASky legacy TAP query](http://esaskylegacy.esac.esa.int/esasky-legacy-sl-tap/tap) as a self-standing catalogue collection, providing a single unified method of accessing all Hipparcos/Tycho data products and their successors.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b You can access them using the [Topcat](http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/) tool, selecting the option \"Table Access Protocol (TAP) Query\" in the VO menu, and introducing the TAP url in the \"Select Service\" pane.\nThe summary of the 42\u00a0data products (or 59\u00a0tables) is shown in Table 1. Hipparcos-1 data products are complete except for identification charts and light-curve figures which can be found in the file Hip1-CDROMs-Volume17.zip\u00a0in the HIPPARCOS\\_PUBLIC\\_DATA area on the ftp.cosmos.esa.int ftp server. Tycho-1 has been completed with the Epoch Photometry Annex B, and Hipparcos-2 and Tycho-2 with Intermediate Astrometry data products. The latter is considered an extension, as these data had never been published before.\u00a0The Tycho Slit Response Functions (SRFs) that have been used in the Tycho-2 data processing can be found [here](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/documents/401090/401110/tycSRF.txt/c7a3383d-462a-eb5f-2420-f4195cf2d021?t=1639135291743)\u00a0and are described [here](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/documents/401090/6118054/Tycho_SRF_ReadMe.txt/4ed9522d-e931-f39b-91ce-79902c1933ac?t=1639135332767).\n**Source:**\nMost tables have been obtained from the CDS/VizieR TAP service, where column labels and descriptions underwent curation by CDS/VizieR. The tables in boldface were downloaded from\u00a0the VizieR ftp instead of TAP service. The data models for hipparcos1 tables #3-#6 were also obtained from the VizieR ftp (so they include CDS metadata curation), including as metadata descriptions both explanations and\u00a0corresponding notes. For 14 tables, we constructed the corresponding data model from the original documentation, using the original Hipparcos column label naming convention and\u00a0including as metadata descriptions the original Hipparcos explanations.\u00a0\nSince the Tycho-1 Epoch Photometry - Annex B data hosted at\u00a0CDS/Vizier was severely corrupted, two tables in data product #32 marked with an asterisk) were\u00a0recovered from original CD-ROMs kindly provided by Claus Fabricius, member of the Tycho consortium.\u00a0Although still presenting a [partial loss of the original data](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/documents/401090/6118054/tyc_epo_ReadMe_28_June_2021.txt/7764a663-366a-5b90-ade9-edadef61530d?t=1624885489525), fewer data records are affected by corruption.\u00a0\nData products #19, #21, #22, #23, #29, #30, #31 and #36 were tables originally stacked together in rows mixing header and data records. For the sake of database ingestion,\u00a0these data products have been split in their basic table structures, and the legacy\\_astro TAP serves them individually. Unique keys allow connecting the records back together.\nHipparcos-2 data products #25-#29 are served in two versions: a CDS/VizieR version (namespace hipparcos2\\_cds) and a Springer book DVD version (namespace hipparcos2\\_dvd). Hipparcos-2 intermediate astrometry is only available on the DVD and it is important that these intermediate data are only used together with the astrometric reference parameters coming from the main tables from the same DVD.\u00a0The raw contents of the DVD can be found in the file\u00a0Hip2-DVD-Book.zip\u00a0in the HIPPARCOS\\_PUBLIC\\_DATA area on the ftp.cosmos.esa.int ftp server.\n**Metadata:**\n*   Sky coordinates RAdeg, DEdeg are provided in ICRS system in units of degrees, with epoch J1991.25 (average observing time for the Hipparcos mission), except for the Tycho-2 Intermediate Astrometry (J1992.0) and the Double Star Catalogue and Supplement and the Two-colour Photometry for Components of Hipparcos Doubles Catalogue, at observation epoch J2000.0.\n*   Currently, our Legacy Archive TAP server does not preserve the data precision for trailing zeroes.

It is constructed from the GSC region number (TYC1)\\[1,9537\\], the running number within the region (TYC2)\\[1,12119\\], and a component identifier (TYC3)\\[1,4\\], separated by a hyphen between them, e.g. TYC 1-13-1.\nHipparcos catalogues, data products and tables\n* Data product # :  1 \n\t*  Catalogue :  Hipparcos-1\t\n\t* Table Name: hipparcos1.hip_main\n\t* Title: The Hipparcos Main

[Cos-B](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Cos-B_overview2) carried a single large experiment, the Gamma-Ray Telescope, which was the responsibility of a group of European research laboratories know as the Caravane Collaboration. Launched on the 9 August 1975, Cos-B was originally projected to last two years, but it operated successfully for 6 years and 8 months. It provided the first complete map of the Galaxy in gamma-rays, and a catalogue of gamma-ray sources, known as the 2CG catalogue.\nThe Cos-B payload was conformed by two elements:\u00a0\n*   Magnetic-core, wire-matrix, spark chamber gamma-ray detector (~30 MeV-5 GeV), eff. area 50 cm2 at 400 MeV\n*   a 2-12 keV proportional scintillation counter mounted on the side of the gamma-ray detector\nThe main scientific results produced by Cos-B were\n*   Extragalactic Gamma Rays\n*   Resolved Galactic Sources\n*   Gamma-Ray Pulsars\n*   Binary Systems\n*   Large Scale Galactic Emission\n*   Localised Gamma-Ray Sources\n**Operations and Performance:**\nThe satellite was operated in a pointing mode with its spin axis directed towards fixed points in the sky for periods of four to five weeks early in the mission and up to 3 months in later observations. In total 64 observations (or pointings) were made.\u00a0A broad band along the galactic equator was studied deeply, by means of repeated or overlapped observations.\u00a0About 50% of the celestial sphere was covered and about one quarter of the time was devoted to observations at higher galactic latitudes, especially regions expected to contain extragalactic sources. The experiment operated for about 25 hours in each 37-hour orbit.\nComparison of data from overlapping observation periods enabled the long-term sensitivity changes of Cos-B to be estimated. Until three years into the mission, the sensitivity was virtually stable, but a slow fall-off developed. From this monitoring, curves such as the empirical correction factors have been derived. However the level of the background component improved with time. This background was due largely to interactions of cosmic rays with the massive parts of the experiment and surrounding spacecraft subsystems. This was reduced significantly by the increasing modulation of the cosmic rays with the approach of the solar maximum. This effect served to counter-balance the reduction in detector sensitivity.\n**Catalogues and Data Products:**\nHitherto, the High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive at HEASARC was the only facility hosting the Cos-B data products in its [Observatories (Past missions) archive](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/cosb/cosb.html). It served raw data (.evt), image (.gif) and exposure maps (.fits) from the gamma-ray detector, and the analysis package FADMAP, alongside with the calibration data. These data have been repatriated to the ESA Legacy Archive in 2021 and are accessible via the [ESASky legacy TAP query](http://esaskylegacy.esac.esa.int/esasky-legacy-sl-tap/tap).\nThe ESA Legacy Archive includes two tables produced by the Cos-B mission. The provenance of these tables is the [HEASARC TAP](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xamin/vo/tap).\nThe COSBMAP table is a log of the 63 x 6 available high level product files per energy range, rendering a total of 1,512 files available. The COSBRAW \u00a0table is a log of the 65 Cos-B observation intervals and contains target names, sky coordinates start times and other information taken from the final Cos-B database produced by ESA in 1985.\nCos-B Catalogues\n*  \\# :  1 \n\t*  Resource :  cosb \n\t*  Catalogue :  cosb.cosbmaps \n\t*  Records :  252 \n\t*  Columns :  20 \n\t*  Table Name :  Cos-B Map Product Catalog \n\t*  Data Products :  datalink column (6 data products) \n*  \\# :  2 \n\t*  Resource :  cosb \n\t*  Catalogue :  cosb.cosbraw \n\t*  Records :  65 \n\t*  Columns :  20 \n\t*  Table Name :  Cos-B Photon Events Catalog \n\t*  Data Products :  event link column (1 data product)\t\t\t\n**High level Products****:** The Cos-B data products consist of maps obtained from the 65 Cos-B observations made during the entire mission. There are 4 sets of maps per observation, extracted over different energy ranges. These energy ranges are:\n*   \"low\" (70-150 MeV),\n*   \"medium\" (150-300 MeV),\n*   \"high\" (300-5000 MeV),\n*   and \"full\" (50-7800 MeV).\nEach set includes three maps: a \"counts\" map, an \"exposure\" map, and a \"flux\" map. The \"flux\" map was obtained by dividing the \"counts\" map for the \"exposure\" maps. Each observation, therefore, has 12 associated maps. These maps are provided via DataLink in FITS and GIF format.\nThe Cos-B data products were created using the program [fadmap](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/FTP/software/ftools/release/help/fadmap.txt). Each of the FITS maps are 120 x 120 pixels with 0.5 degrees per pixel. Header keywords record the parameter values used in fadmap (see below) to create the maps. The FITS images may be displayed using any standard package which accepts FITS images.\nThe file\\_image column corresponds to the name of the events file in the archive associated with each observation. Files are of the form cb\\_hhmmVddP\\*\\*t\\_b.xxx, where cb is the instrument (Cos-B), hhmm is the right ascension in degrees and minutes, V is N for positive declinations and S is for negative declination, dd is the declination in degrees, P is for 'Pointed' observations '\\*\\*' is the original observation number, from 00 to 64, t is the datafile 'type' (b for 'background', s for 'source'), b is the 'band' (l for 'low', m for 'medium', h for 'high', and t for 'total') and xxx is the FITS file 'type' (img for 'image', exp for 'exposure', flux for 'modified flux map' or gif for 'graphical image format'). There will be one GIF image for the source image, exposure map and flux map. These GIFs will have the form cb\\_hhmmVddP\\*\\*t\\_b\\_X.gif, where all the values are the same as for the ordinary FITS maps, but the value 'X' will distinguish which file is represented in the GIF. 'X' will be 'i' (for image), 'e' (for exposure) and 'f' (for flux). An example filename would be cb\\_1721s44p24s\\_l\\_i.gif. This file is a Cos-B point centered on RA=17h21m, DEC=-44, the original Cos-B point number 24, source image file in the 'low' energy band, in GIF format.\nThe \\* .img \\*.exp and \\*.flux maps associated to the cb\\_0109s74p15.evt and cb\\_1841n80p35.evt events were not generated because the original code only allows to build maps with declination between -65 deg to 65 deg. These two files are at -74 and +80, respectively.\nRaw data: The final reduction of the Cos\\-B data, released by ESA in 1985, consisted of three basic datasets: \\`OBSLI\\`, describing each observation period (typically one month), \\`OURLI\\`, describing each uninterrupted observation interval (lasting between 10 minutes and 10 hours), and \\`GAMLI\\`, containing records for each accepted gamma-ray photon. These three data sets were combined into FITS format with an event layout at the HEASARC.\nEach event file contains three extensions: good time interval (EXTNAME = 'ALLGTI'), event (EXTNAME = 'EVENTS'), and housekeeping (EXTNAME = 'TSI'). The ALLGTI and TSI extensions contain the information stored in the \\`OURLI\\` and \\`OBSLI\\` datasets. The EVENTS extension contains data from the \\`GAMLI\\` dataset. There are, in total, 65 files, one for each \\`OBSLI\\` observation. Photon positions (RA and DEC) were converted to pixels within a 512 X 512 pixel pseudo-image array. Each pixel is 0.1 degrees so the image is 51.2 X 51.2 degrees.\nThe program [fadmap](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/FTP/software/ftools/release/help/fadmap.txt) can be used on the raw data files to generate maps with different parameter setups or different time selections from those used for the high level products.\nThe COSBRAW \u00a0database consisted of three basic datasets: \\`OBSLI\\`, a dataset describing each observation period, typically a month; \\`OURLI\\`, a dataset describing each uninterrupted observation interval, lasting between 10 minutes and 10 hours; and \\`GAMLI\\`, a dataset containing records for each accepted gamma-ray photon. These three data sets were combined into FITS format images at NASA/GSFC. The images were formed by making the center pixel of a 1024 x 1024 pixel image correspond to the RA and DEC given in the \\`OBSLI\\` file.

Further improved catalogues were made available to the science community later. This Galaxy charter mission has produced four major catalogues referred to as the Hipparcos-1 Catalogue, the Tycho-1 Catalogue, the Hipparcos-2 Catalogue, and the Tycho-2 Catalogue.\nThese are the 42\u00a0Hipparcos data products (catalogues and annexes) currently available via the [ESASky legacy TAP query](http://esaskylegacy.esac.esa.int/esasky-legacy-sl-tap/tap) as a self-standing catalogue collection, providing a single unified method of accessing all Hipparcos/Tycho data products and their successors.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b You can access them using the [Topcat](http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/) tool, selecting the option \"Table Access Protocol (TAP) Query\" in the VO menu, and introducing the TAP url in the \"Select Service\" pane.\nThe summary of the 42\u00a0data products (or 59\u00a0tables) is shown in Table 1. Hipparcos-1 data products are complete except for identification charts and light-curve figures which can be found in the file Hip1-CDROMs-Volume17.zip\u00a0in the HIPPARCOS\\_PUBLIC\\_DATA area on the ftp.cosmos.esa.int ftp server. Tycho-1 has been completed with the Epoch Photometry Annex B, and Hipparcos-2 and Tycho-2 with Intermediate Astrometry data products. The latter is considered an extension, as these data had never been published before.\u00a0The Tycho Slit Response Functions (SRFs) that have been used in the Tycho-2 data processing can be found [here](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/documents/401090/401110/tycSRF.txt/c7a3383d-462a-eb5f-2420-f4195cf2d021?t=1639135291743)\u00a0and are described [here](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/documents/401090/6118054/Tycho_SRF_ReadMe.txt/4ed9522d-e931-f39b-91ce-79902c1933ac?t=1639135332767).\n**Source:**\nMost tables have been obtained from the CDS/VizieR TAP service, where column labels and descriptions underwent curation by CDS/VizieR. The tables in boldface were downloaded from\u00a0the VizieR ftp instead of TAP service. The data models for hipparcos1 tables #3-#6 were also obtained from the VizieR ftp (so they include CDS metadata curation), including as metadata descriptions both explanations and\u00a0corresponding notes. For 14 tables, we constructed the corresponding data model from the original documentation, using the original Hipparcos column label naming convention and\u00a0including as metadata descriptions the original Hipparcos explanations.\u00a0\nSince the Tycho-1 Epoch Photometry - Annex B data hosted at\u00a0CDS/Vizier was severely corrupted, two tables in data product #32 marked with an asterisk) were\u00a0recovered from original CD-ROMs kindly provided by Claus Fabricius, member of the Tycho consortium.\u00a0Although still presenting a [partial loss of the original data](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/documents/401090/6118054/tyc_epo_ReadMe_28_June_2021.txt/7764a663-366a-5b90-ade9-edadef61530d?t=1624885489525), fewer data records are affected by corruption.\u00a0\nData products #19, #21, #22, #23, #29, #30, #31 and #36 were tables originally stacked together in rows mixing header and data records. For the sake of database ingestion,\u00a0these data products have been split in their basic table structures, and the legacy\\_astro TAP serves them individually. Unique keys allow connecting the records back together.\nHipparcos-2 data products #25-#29 are served in two versions: a CDS/VizieR version (namespace hipparcos2\\_cds) and a Springer book DVD version (namespace hipparcos2\\_dvd). Hipparcos-2 intermediate astrometry is only available on the DVD and it is important that these intermediate data are only used together with the astrometric reference parameters coming from the main tables from the same DVD.\u00a0The raw contents of the DVD can be found in the file\u00a0Hip2-DVD-Book.zip\u00a0in the HIPPARCOS\\_PUBLIC\\_DATA area on the ftp.cosmos.esa.int ftp server.\n**Metadata:**\n*   Sky coordinates RAdeg, DEdeg are provided in ICRS system in units of degrees, with epoch J1991.25 (average observing time for the Hipparcos mission), except for the Tycho-2 Intermediate Astrometry (J1992.0) and the Double Star Catalogue and Supplement and the Two-colour Photometry for Components of Hipparcos Doubles Catalogue, at observation epoch J2000.0.\n*   Currently, our Legacy Archive TAP server does not preserve the data precision for trailing zeroes. To retrieve the table precision information, please refer to the original table data model section and table number in [Hipparcos Vol 1: Introduction and Guide to the Data](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/documents/532822/552851/vol1_all.pdf/99adf6e3-6893-4824-8fc2-8d3c9cbba2b5), provided in column #8\n*   Question marks in the table descriptions are equivalent to dagger in the table data model shown in the documentation, meaning blank for undefined values.\n*   Asterisk at the beginning of the column description and numbers in brackets at the end of descriptions refer to Notes in the [Hipparcos Vol 1: Introduction and Guide to the Data](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/documents/532822/552851/vol1_all.pdf/99adf6e3-6893-4824-8fc2-8d3c9cbba2b5)\n*   The original hipparcos1.hipoint and hipparcos1.hipjtran records have several occurrences of type overflow that have been replaced by \"null\" values.\n*   For 6 Tycho tables, a Tycho identifier (ID) was created as an aggregate of the TYC numbers. It is constructed from the GSC region number (TYC1)\\[1,9537\\], the running number within the region (TYC2)\\[1,12119\\], and a component identifier (TYC3)\\[1,4\\], separated by a hyphen between them, e.g. TYC 1-13-1.\nHipparcos catalogues, data products and tables\n* Data product # :  1 \n\t*  Catalogue :  Hipparcos-1\t\n\t* Table Name: hipparcos1.hip_main\n\t* Title: The Hipparcos Main

experiment, the Gamma-Ray Telescope, which was the responsibility of a group of European research laboratories know as the Caravane Collaboration. Launched on the 9 August 1975, Cos-B was originally projected to last two years, but it operated successfully for 6 years and 8 months. It provided the first complete map of the Galaxy in gamma-rays, and a catalogue of gamma-ray sources, known as the 2CG catalogue.\nThe Cos-B payload was conformed by two elements:\u00a0\n*   Magnetic-core, wire-matrix, spark chamber gamma-ray detector (~30 MeV-5 GeV), eff. area 50 cm2 at 400 MeV\n*   a 2-12 keV proportional scintillation counter mounted on the side of the gamma-ray detector\nThe main scientific results produced by Cos-B were\n*   Extragalactic Gamma Rays\n*   Resolved Galactic Sources\n*   Gamma-Ray Pulsars\n*   Binary Systems\n*   Large Scale Galactic Emission\n*   Localised Gamma-Ray Sources\n**Operations and Performance:**\nThe satellite was operated in a pointing mode with its spin axis directed towards fixed points in the sky for periods of four to five weeks early in the mission and up to 3 months in later observations. In total 64 observations (or pointings) were made.\u00a0A broad band along the galactic equator was studied deeply, by means of repeated or overlapped observations.\u00a0About 50% of the celestial sphere was covered and about one quarter of the time was devoted to observations at higher galactic latitudes, especially regions expected to contain extragalactic sources. The experiment operated for about 25 hours in each 37-hour orbit.\nComparison of data from overlapping observation periods enabled the long-term sensitivity changes of Cos-B to be estimated. Until three years into the mission, the sensitivity was virtually stable, but a slow fall-off developed. From this monitoring, curves such as the empirical correction factors have been derived. However the level of the background component improved with time. This background was due largely to interactions of cosmic rays with the massive parts of the experiment and surrounding spacecraft subsystems. This was reduced significantly by the increasing modulation of the cosmic rays with the approach of the solar maximum. This effect served to counter-balance the reduction in detector sensitivity.\n**Catalogues and Data Products:**\nHitherto, the High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive at HEASARC was the only facility hosting the Cos-B data products in its [Observatories (Past missions) archive](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/cosb/cosb.html). It served raw data (.evt), image (.gif) and exposure maps (.fits) from the gamma-ray detector, and the analysis package FADMAP, alongside with the calibration data. These data have been repatriated to the ESA Legacy Archive in 2021 and are accessible via the [ESASky legacy TAP query](http://esaskylegacy.esac.esa.int/esasky-legacy-sl-tap/tap).\nThe ESA Legacy Archive includes two tables produced by the Cos-B mission. The provenance of these tables is the [HEASARC TAP](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xamin/vo/tap).\nThe COSBMAP table is a log of the 63 x 6 available high level product files per energy range, rendering a total of 1,512 files available. The COSBRAW \u00a0table is a log of the 65 Cos-B observation intervals and contains target names, sky coordinates start times and other information taken from the final Cos-B database produced by ESA in 1985.\nCos-B Catalogues\n*  \\# :  1 \n\t*  Resource :  cosb \n\t*  Catalogue :  cosb.cosbmaps \n\t*  Records :  252 \n\t*  Columns :  20 \n\t*  Table Name :  Cos-B Map Product Catalog \n\t*  Data Products :  datalink column (6 data products)\n*  \\# :  2 \n\t*Resource: cosb \n\t*Catalogue: cosb.cosbraw \n\t*Records: 65 \n\t*Columns: 20 \n\t*Table Name: Cos-B Photon Events Catalog \n\t*Data Products: event link column (1 data product)\t\t\t\n**High level Products****:** The Cos-B data products consist of maps obtained from the 65 Cos-B observations made during the entire mission. There are 4 sets of maps per observation, extracted over different energy ranges. These energy ranges are:\n*   \"low\" (70-150 MeV),\n*   \"medium\" (150-300 MeV),\n*   \"high\" (300-5000 MeV),\n*   and \"full\" (50-7800 MeV).\nEach set includes three maps: a \"counts\" map, an \"exposure\" map, and a \"flux\" map. The \"flux\" map was obtained by dividing the \"counts\" map for the \"exposure\" maps. Each observation, therefore, has 12 associated maps. These maps are provided via DataLink in FITS and GIF format.\nThe Cos-B data products were created using the program [fadmap](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/FTP/software/ftools/release/help/fadmap.txt). Each of the FITS maps are 120 x 120 pixels with 0.5 degrees per pixel. Header keywords record the parameter values used in fadmap (see below) to create the maps. The FITS images may be displayed using any standard package which accepts FITS images.\nThe file\\_image column corresponds to the name of the events file in the archive associated with each observation. Files are of the form cb\\_hhmmVddP\\*\\*t\\_b.xxx, where cb is the instrument (Cos-B), hhmm is the right ascension in degrees and minutes, V is N for positive declinations and S is for negative declination, dd is the declination in degrees, P is for 'Pointed' observations '\\*\\*' is the original observation number, from 00 to 64, t is the datafile 'type' (b for 'background', s for 'source'), b is the 'band' (l for 'low', m for 'medium', h for 'high', and t for 'total') and xxx is the FITS file 'type' (img for 'image', exp for 'exposure', flux for 'modified flux map' or gif for 'graphical image format'). There will be one GIF image for the source image, exposure map and flux map. These GIFs will have the form cb\\_hhmmVddP\\*\\*t\\_b\\_X.gif, where all the values are the same as for the ordinary FITS maps, but the value 'X' will distinguish which file is represented in the GIF. 'X' will be 'i' (for image), 'e' (for exposure) and 'f' (for flux). An example filename would be cb\\_1721s44p24s\\_l\\_i.gif. This file is a Cos-B point centered on RA=17h21m, DEC=-44, the original Cos-B point number 24, source image file in the 'low' energy band, in GIF format.\nThe \\* .img \\*.exp and \\*.flux maps associated to the cb\\_0109s74p15.evt and cb\\_1841n80p35.evt events were not generated because the original code only allows to build maps with declination between -65 deg to 65 deg. These two files are at -74 and +80, respectively.\nRaw data: The final reduction of the Cos\\-B data, released by ESA in 1985, consisted of three basic datasets: \\`OBSLI\\`, describing each observation period (typically one month), \\`OURLI\\`, describing each uninterrupted observation interval (lasting between 10 minutes and 10 hours), and \\`GAMLI\\`, containing records for each accepted gamma-ray photon. These three data sets were combined into FITS format with an event layout at the HEASARC.\nEach event file contains three extensions: good time interval (EXTNAME = 'ALLGTI'), event (EXTNAME = 'EVENTS'), and housekeeping (EXTNAME = 'TSI'). The ALLGTI and TSI extensions contain the information stored in the \\`OURLI\\` and \\`OBSLI\\` datasets. The EVENTS extension contains data from the \\`GAMLI\\` dataset. There are, in total, 65 files, one for each \\`OBSLI\\` observation. Photon positions (RA and DEC) were converted to pixels within a 512 X 512 pixel pseudo-image array. Each pixel is 0.1 degrees so the image is 51.2 X 51.2 degrees.\nThe program [fadmap](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/FTP/software/ftools/release/help/fadmap.txt) can be used on the raw data files to generate maps with different parameter setups or different time selections from those used for the high level products.\nThe COSBRAW \u00a0database consisted of three basic datasets: \\`OBSLI\\`, a dataset describing each observation period, typically a month; \\`OURLI\\`, a dataset describing each uninterrupted observation interval, lasting between 10 minutes and 10 hours; and \\`GAMLI\\`, a dataset containing records for each accepted gamma-ray photon. These three data sets were combined into FITS format images at NASA/GSFC. The images were formed by making the center pixel of a 1024 x 1024 pixel image correspond to the RA and DEC given in the \\`OBSLI\\` file. Each photon's RA and DEC was converted to a relative pixel in the image. This was done by using Aitoff projections. All the raw data from these three Cos-B files are now stored in 65 FITS files accessible via DataLink.\nThe Cos-B event files naming convention is cb\\_hhmmVddP\\*\\*.evt where \u00a0hhmm is the right ascension in degrees and minutes, V is N for positive declinations and S is for negative declination, dd is the declination in degrees, P is for 'Pointed' observations '\\*\\*' is the original observation number, from 00 to 64. (e.g CB2251S18P41.evt was the 42nd observation, and the source coordinates are RA 2251 DEC -18).", "meta": {"H1": "ESASky Legacy TAP: ESA Legacy Missions - ESDC - Cosmos", "H3": "Legacy archive (Cos-B):", "URL": "https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/esdc/legacy-tap-esa#Legacy:CosB", "ID": "114"}, "questions": ["What was the main experiment carried by the Cos-B satellite?", "How long did the Cos-B satellite operate successfully?", "What were the main scientific results produced by Cos-B?", "How was the Cos-B satellite operated in terms of pointing mode and observation periods?", "How did the sensitivity of Cos-B change over time?", "Where were the Cos-B data products previously hosted and where are they accessible now?", "What tables are included in the ESA Legacy Archive from the Cos-B mission?", "What is the purpose of the ESA Legacy Archive?", "How many tables produced by the Cos-B mission are included in the ESA Legacy Archive?", "What information does the COSBMAP table contain?", "How many data products are available in the Cos-B Map Product Catalog?", "What are the energy ranges for the Cos-B data products?", "How many maps are associated with each Cos-B observation?", "What program was used to create the Cos-B data products?", "What is the format of the FITS images in the archive?", "How are the GIF images named in the archive?", "Can the FITS images be displayed using any standard package that accepts FITS images?", "What is the naming convention for the GIF files in the Legacy archive (Cos-B)?", "Why were the maps associated with the cb_0109s74p15.evt and cb_1841n80p35.evt events not generated?", "What were the three basic datasets in the final reduction of the Cos-B data?", "How were photon positions converted to pixels in the Cos-B event files?", "What is the naming convention for the Cos-B event files?"]}, {"context": "Legacy archive (CoRoT):\n[CoRoT](https://sci.esa.int/web/corot/)(Convection, Rotation and planetary Transits) is the first space mission dedicated to exoplanetary research and designed for this purpose. The spacecraft was equipped with a 27 cm-diameter afocal telescope and a 4-CCD wide-field camera, was built around the PROTEUS spacecraft bus, and operated in a low-Earth orbit (LEO) of ~900 km (polar). Launched in December 2006 the mission had a nominal lifetime of 2.5 years. The scientific mission was officially ended the 20th of June 2013 and the satellite was de-orbited on 17 June 2014. During its observation phase, CoRoT continuously observed star fields in the Milky Way for periods of up to 6 months, recording the photometric light curve of about 150 distinct bright stars (with a visible magnitude between 5.8 and 8) using the bright stars channel (also known as the seismology channel) and more than 160 000 faint stars (with a visible magnitude between 10.5 and 16) using the faint stars channel (also known as the exoplanet channel. The project was led by CNES, with contributions from ESA, Austria, Belgium, Germany, Spain and Brazil.\nFrom a polar inertial circular orbit (90-degree inclination) at an altitude of 896 km, the CoRoT programme of observations was based on a yearly cycle of 4 runs. During the summer period from October to March, the telescope was pointed towards the anticentre of the Milky Way and during the winter period from April to September, in the opposite direction. Two observation runs (alternately 20 and 150 days) were achieved during each summer and winter period in general. Twice a year, when the Sun got closer to the orbit plane and was about to blind the telescope, the spacecraft performed a reversal attitude manoeuvre.\nSome of the features of the 26 CoRoT fields are extracted from [2018A&A...619A..97D](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2018/11/aa31068-17/aa31068-17.html)\nSummary of the CoRoT runs\n| Field | CCD | Start date | Duration | Overlap     | Targets |\n|-------|-----|------------|----------|-------------|---------|\n|       |     | (dd/mm/aa) | (days)   |             |         |\n| IRa01 | 2   | 06/02/2007 | 54.3     | LRa01/LRa06 | 9,921   |\n| LRa01 | 2   | 23/10/2007 | 131.5    | IRa01/LRa06 | 11,448  |\n| SRa01 | 2   | 21/03/2008 | 23.4     | SRa05       | 8,190   |\n| SRa02 | 2   | 11/10/2008 | 31.8     | LRa07       | 10,305  |\n| LRa02 | 2   | 16/11/2008 | 114.7    |             | 11,448  |\n| LRa03 | 1   | 03/10/2009 | 148.3    |             | 5,329   |\n| SRa03 | 1   | 05/03/2010 | 24.3     |             | 4,169   |\n| LRa04 | 1   | 29/09/2010 | 77.6     |             | 4,262   |\n| LRa05 | 1   | 21/12/2010 | 90.5     |             | 4,648   |\n| SRa04 | 1   | 07/10/2011 | 52.3     |             | 5,588   |\n| SRa05 | 1   | 01/12/2011 | 38.7     | SRa01       | 4,213   |\n| LRa06 | 1   | 12/01/2012 | 76.7     | LRa01/IRa01 | 5,724   |\n| LRa07 | 1   | 04/10/2012 | 29.3     | SRa02       | 4,844   |\n|       |     |            |          |             |         |\n| SRc01 | 2   | 13/04/2007 | 25.6     | \u2013           | 7,015   |\n| LRc01 | 2   | 16/05/2007 | 142.1    |             | 11,448  |\n| LRc02 | 2   | 15/04/2008 | 145      | LRc06/LRc05 | 11,448  |\n| SRc02 | 2   | 15/09/2008 | 20.9     |             | 11,448  |\n| LRc03 | 1   | 03/04/2009 | 89.2     |             | 5,724   |\n| LRc04 | 1   | 07/07/2009 | 84.2     | LRc10       | 5,724   |\n| LRc05 | 1   | 08/04/2010 | 87.3     | LRc06       | 5,724   |\n| LRc06 | 1   | 08/07/2010 | 77.4     | LRc02/LRc05 | 5,724   |\n| LRc07 | 1   | 08/04/2011 | 81.3     | LRc08/LRc10 | 5,724   |\n| SRc03 | 1   | 01/07/2011 | 20.9     | LRc02/LRc06 | 652     |\n| LRc08 | 1   | 08/07/2011 | 83.6     | LRc07/LRc10 | 5,724   |\n| LRc09 | 1   | 12/04/2012 | 83.6     |             | 5,724   |\n| LRc10 | 1   | 09/07/2012 | 83.5     | LRc04/LRc07 | 5,286   |\n|       |     |            |          |             |         |\n| Total |     |            |          |             | 163,665 |\n[CoRoT](https://corot.cnes.fr/en/COROT/index.htm) produced nearly 6 years of data that are accessible online.

It focuses on the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres, a new field of research, including photometric and spectroscopic observations and spanning the wavelength range from X-rays to the IR. At stake are the molecular composition of giant exoplanet atmospheres, tracing their formation and evolution, as well as the atmosphere of rocky exoplanets and the potential presence of biosignature gases. Yet, these observations are challenging because the signal is often embedded in instrumental and telescope systematic noise.\nPart of the Exoplanets-A project concerns the development of new data calibration, spectral extraction and retrieval tools. They all aim to exploit archival data from both international space missions and ground-based facilities to produce a consistent and reliable characterization of exoplanet atmospheres as well as to study the influence of host stars on them.\nThe properties of the exoplanet host stars are key factors to understanding the environment within which the exoplanet lies and estimating the energy inputs into its atmosphere. This influence comes by two different ways: the basic properties of the star have an obvious effect on the planet and in particular, X-ray and UV luminosity affect the formation and the atmospheric properties of the planets. The primary online archival databases used are XMM-Newton, Chandra and ROSAT catalogues while primary databases in UV are HST (for UV spectra) and GALEX (for UV photometry) catalogues. Optical observations provide extreme-precision stellar parameters such as its luminosity, effective temperature and radius, which in turn have an impact in the retrieval process of the planetary-atmosphere properties. All targets have been identified from the Gaia/DR2 data in order to extract key values about astrometric properties, such as proper motions and distances of host stars. The variability information of host stars is derived from different projects (mainly Kepler and Kepler K2). The characterization of exoplanet atmospheres is studied with spectroscopy at infrared wavelengths using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Spitzer archived space data. Soon, two future space mission will enrich the spectroscopic data with unprecedented sensitivity: James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Ariel.\nThe [exoplanets & Host stars catalogue](https://www.explore-exoplanets.eu/resource/exoplanets-host-stars/) is a coherent and uniform database of the relevant properties from International Space Science archives (e.g. HST, XMM, Gaia, Spitzer, Kepler), combined with ground-based data and publications. Exoplanet and host star properties are accompanied/interpreted with results from the Exoplanets-A project. The catalogue includes all the exoplanetary systems being studied by the Exoplanets-A project: It contains information for 205 exoplanets and 113 host-stars.\nThe [star-planet interaction catalogue](https://www.explore-exoplanets.eu/resource/star-planet-interactions/) provides a list of parameters that can be used to assess the strength of these interactions: X and UV stellar flux, plasma conditions at the planetary orbit, tidal dissipation coefficients, among others. The majority of these parameters were estimated thanks to cutting-edge models at the forefront of the research on exoplanetary science.\nExoplanets-A Catalogues\n| \\# | Resource   | Catalogue                  | Records | Columns | Table Name                                      | Data Products |\n|---|------------|----------------------------|---------|---------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| 1 | exoplaneta | exoplaneta.exostars        | 205     | 766     | Exoplanet-A Exoplanets and host stars Catalogue |               |\n| 2 | exoplaneta | exoplaneta.starplanetinter | 149     | 83      | Exoplanet-A Star-planet interaction Catalogue   |               |", "meta": {"H1": "ESASky Legacy TAP: EU-funded Projects - ESDC - Cosmos", "H3": "EXOPLANETS-A:", "URL": "https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/esdc/legacy-tap-eu#Exoplanets-A", "ID": "118"}, "questions": ["What is the focus of the Exoplanets-A project?", "What are some of the challenges in observing exoplanet atmospheres?", "What are the primary online archival databases used in the Exoplanets-A project?", "How are the properties of exoplanet host stars important in understanding exoplanet atmospheres?", "What future space missions will contribute to the study of exoplanet atmospheres?", "How many exoplanets and host stars are included in the Exoplanets-A catalogue?", "What information does the star-planet interaction catalogue provide?", "How many records and columns are in the Exoplanet-A Exoplanets and host stars Catalogue?", "How many records and columns are in the Exoplanet-A Star-planet interaction Catalogue?"]}, {"context": "STARFORMMAPPER:\n[StarFormMapper](https://starformmapper.org/) (European H2020 RIA project with [DOI:10.3030/687528](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/687528)) is a scientific study into the formation and evolution of massive stars and their natal clusters. The key aim of the project is to combine data from two of ESA major space missions, Gaia and Herschel, together with ground based facilities, to constrain the mechanisms that underlie both how massive stars themselves form, but more fundamentally, how their natal clusters evolve around them. The combination of the data from two ESA missions enables the study of clusters and associations of stars when they are very young (much less than 1 Myr old), when the structures we see are a better match to the initial conditions. These novel data and the complexity of the combined datasets required the development of new analysis and visualization tools. In particular, we statistically compared hybrid large scale N-body + SPH models with the combined 6-dimensional Gaia plus Herschel and gas kinematical data.\nThe StarFormMapper project explored optimal methods of detecting substructure in both dust/molecular gas maps (including radial velocity information for the gas), as well as in the stellar component of young clusters. Hence, it produced catalogues of subclusters as well as catalogues of compact and extended molecular cloud components (molecular cores and clumps).\nFour catalogues of the significant substructure found in four star-forming regions are described in Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2021. The S2D2 (Small Significant DBSCAN Detection) method was applied to catalogues of YSO members of Taurus (Luhman, 2018), IC348 (Luhman et al., 2016), Upper Scorpius (Luhman et al., 2018) and Carina (Kuhn et al., 2014) to produce a catalogue of local, compact substructures in each star-forming region.\nNony T., Robitaille J.-F., Motte F., et al., 2021 characterized the structure of the NGC 2264 molecular cloud and compared the populations of clumps and young stellar objects (YSOs). This work separated the Herschel column density map of NGC 2264 into three subregions and compared their cloud power spectra using a multiscale segmentation technique. They extracted compact cloud fragments from the column density image, measured their basic properties, and studied their spatial and mass distributions. These results are published as a catalogue in [CDS/Vizier](https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/645/A94).\nStarFormMapper Catalogues\n| #  | Resource | Catalogue                    | Records | Columns | Table Name                                                                                              | Data Products |\n|----|----------|------------------------------|---------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| 1  | sfm      | sfm.nh2clumps_ngc_2264       | 256     | 20      | Column density and information for the 256 clumps found in NGC 2264                                     |               |\n| 2  | sfm      | sfm.s2d2                     | 8       | 7       | Result Summary of S2D2 applied to four star forming regions: Taurus, IC 348, Upper Scorpius, and Carina |               |\n| 3  | sfm      | sfm.s2d2_carina_nests        | 21      | 4       | Significant Substructure (NESTS) Catalogue in the Carina region                                         |               |\n| 4  | sfm      | sfm.s2d2_carina_yso          | 2,782   | 4       | Young Stellar Object catalogue in the Carina region                                                     |               |\n| 5  | sfm      | sfm.s2d2_ic348_nests         | 6       | 4       | Significant Substructure (NESTS) Catalogue in the region IC 348                                         |               |\n| 6  | sfm      | sfm.s2d2_ic348_yso           | 465     | 4       | Young Stellar Object catalogue in the IC 348 region                                                     |               |\n| 7  | sfm      | sfm.s2d2_taurus_nests        | 21      | 4       | Significant Substructure (NESTS) Catalogue in the Taurus region                                         |               |\n| 8  | sfm      | sfm.s2d2_taurus_yso          | 405     | 4       | Young Stellar Object catalogue in the Taurus region                                                     |               |\n| 9  | sfm      | sfm.s2d2_upperscorpius_nests | 25      | 4       | Significant Substructure (NESTS) Catalogue in the Upper Scorpius region                                 |               |\n| 10 | sfm      | sfm.s2d2_upperscorpius_yso   | 1,611   | 4       | Young Stellar Object catalogue in the Upper Scorpius region                                             |               |", "meta": {"H1": "ESASky Legacy TAP: EU-funded Projects - ESDC - Cosmos", "H3": "STARFORMMAPPER:", "URL": "https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/esdc/legacy-tap-eu#StarFormMapper", "ID": "119"}, "questions": ["What is the main aim of the STARFORMMAPPER project?", "Which data sources did the STARFORMMAPPER project combine?", "What method was used to detect substructure in the star-forming regions?", "How many catalogues of substructure were produced in the STARFORMMAPPER project?", "What did the study of the NGC 2264 molecular cloud focus on?", "What is the purpose of the work by Nony T., Robitaille J.-F., Motte F., et al.?", "What technique did they use to compare the cloud power spectra of different subregions?", "Where are the results of their work published?", "What is the sfm.nh2clumps_ngc_2264 catalogue?", "What is the sfm.s2d2 catalogue?", "How many clumps are found in the sfm.nh2clumps_ngc_2264 catalogue?", "How many records are there in the sfm.s2d2_carina_yso catalogue?", "What is the purpose of the sfm.s2d2_carina_nests catalogue?", "How many records are there in the sfm.s2d2_upperscorpius_yso catalogue?", "What is the purpose of the sfm.s2d2_upperscorpius_nests catalogue?"]}, {"context": "UPCOMING FEATURES\n - [INTEGRAL](http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/esdc/esasky-skies#INTEGRAL)\n - [XMM-Newton](http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/esdc/esasky-skies#XMM)\n - [EXOSAT](http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/esdc/esasky-skies#EXOSAT)\n - [HST](http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/esdc/esasky-skies#HST)\n - [JWST](http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/esdc/esasky-skies#JWST)\n - [ISO](http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/esdc/esasky-skies#ISO)\n - [Spitzer](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/esdc/esasky-skies#SPITZER)\n - [AKARI](http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/esdc/esasky-skies#AKARI)\n - [Herschel](http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/esdc/esasky-skies#HERSCHEL)\n - [Planck](http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/esdc/esasky-skies#PLANCK)\n - [Haslam 408 MHz](http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/esdc/esasky-skies#Haslam)\n - [Other surveys](http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/esdc/esasky-skies#OTHERS)\n - [Of the data](http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/esdc/esasky-caveats#DATA)\n - [Of the catalogues](http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/esdc/esasky-caveats#CATS)\n[Of the all-sky views (HiPS)}(http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/esdc/esasky-caveats#HIPS)\nSKIES (HIPS) INFORMATION\nAll-sky views on ESASky are Hierarchical Progressive Surveys (HiPS). These maps are based on the HEALPix tesselation of the sky, but have the advantage that provide different spatial resolutions depending on the size of the sky area being visualized, thus increasing performance speed.\nIMPORTANT: The HiPS are intended for visualization only. They are not science-ready products and should not be used to perform scientific data analysis. \nThe HiPS on ESASky have been generated using all the observations of a given instrument/band/mission. The specific products used depend on the mission (see below) and are not always science-ready products. In case of overlap between observations, an average of the pixel values was computed by the HiPS generation code. The code used a single set of cuts and transfer function per band, determined by finding a compromise between fields with very different dynamical range. In the case of XMM and INTEGRAL, a pre-processing was done prior to the HiPS generation to enhance field visibility with a general set of cuts. More details on this and other known caveats of the currently available HiPS are explained here.\nAt present, ESASky displays HiPS for the following missions and surveys:\nINTEGRAL (IBIS)\nXMM-Newton (EPIC & OM)\neROSITA (created by MPE)\nEXOSAT (LE)\nHST (ACS, WFPC2, WFC3, NICMOS, FOC, WFPC)\nJWST (MIRI, NIRCam, NIRISS)\nISO (CAM)\nAKARI (FIS)\nSpitzer (IRAC)\nHerschel (PACS & SPIRE)\nPlanck (HFI & LFI)\nHaslam 408 MHz\nOther surveys (available through external sites)\nDetails on the available HiPS for each mission, together with input data and processing information, are given below. \nThe individual HiPS can be visualized on a browser using Aladin Lite (in JPEG or PNG format), or in your local machine using Aladin Desktop (in FITS format when available, otherwise in JPEG or PNG). Just copy-paste the corresponding HiPS URL.\nFor more information on the HiPS concept, go to this CDS webpage.\nINTEGRAL\nAn RGB colour composite INTEGRAL/IBIS HiPS map (red: 20-35 keV; green: 35-65 keV; blue: 65-100 keV; jpeg format only) constructed from all public data (up to October 2015) by G. Belanger (INTEGRAL SOC). These data were processed in subsets based on proximity in time and space, before being combined into the set of mosaics subsequently used to generate the all-sky map. Each energy band was processed separately.\nThe shown significance maps result from dividing the intensity by the variance. The cuts in the value of significance in each band were defined such that a (hard) source with a power-law photon spectral index of -2 (like the Crab) would appear white, taking into account the energy-dependent instrumental sensitivity. Sources with steeper (softer) spectra look greener/redder, and sources with flatter (harder) spectra look bluer. \nCreated: October 2015\nLast updated: May 2016\nURL: http://skies.esac.esa.int/Integral/color/\nProduct info:\n- Instrument(s): IBIS/ISGRI\n- Passband(s): 20-35 keV, 35-65 keV, 65-100 keV \n- Observation mode(s): Standard photon-by-photon\n- Number of observations: ~120,000 pointings \nProduct processing info:\n- Software and version: Aladin/Hipsgen v.8.174\n- Input data processing pipeline: OSA 10.1\n- Input data processing level: IMA\n- Input data processing date: April 2016\n- Input data retrieval date: May 2016  \n- Input data source: INTEGRAL SOC \nXMM-NEWTON\nXMM-Newton HiPS maps were created from public high-level image products generated by the XMM-Newton SOC (P.

Therefore, some footprints will appear on apparently empty (non-observed) sky areas. \nDue to the fact that observations with very different flux levels coexisted on the same sky area,  JPEG files were used to generate the HiPS, as these files had previously fixed flux cuts. Although it avoided the cut issue described in the caveats section, this approach allowed less flexibility in the choice of the HiPS generation parameters. As a consequence, some features such as gaps between detectors or detector corners with low sensitivity to light could not be removed from the images, and are clearly visible in the resulting HiPS (e.g. for HST/ACS).\nIn most HST HiPS, some misalignments between images exist; their value is very small (<2 arcsec), but clearly visible due to the very high resolution of the detectors.. As a result, in some regions objects appear duplicated or more after the images are combined in the HiPS generation. The issue has been reported to the eHST team. \nThere is also a small positional offset (< 1\") between the source coordinates from the HSC and their location on the HST HiPS maps. This is due to the fact that the HST HiPS where generated from HST data products, while the HSC was created from HLA data products, and there is a discrepancy between the astrometric solutions from both samples.\n\u200b\nJWST\nThe JWST HiPS maps are created by grouping all available public science images from a given instrument and updated frequently (daily) with the latest images. \nThe following maps are available:\nJWST MIRI Imaging\nJWST MIRI Coronagraphic Imaging\nJWST NIRCam Imaging\nJWST NIRCam Coronagraphic Imaging\nJWST NIRISS Imaging\nFirst created: July 2022 (continuously updated)\nURL: https://skies.esac.esa.int/JWST/\nProduct info:\n- Instrument(s): MIRI, NIRCam, NIRISS\n- Passband(s): All imaging filter bands for each instrument. \n- Wavelength(s): MIRI imaging: 5.6-25.5 microns; MIRI Coronagraphic imaging: 10-23 microns; NIRCam imaging: 0.6-5.0 microns; NIRCam Coronagraphic imaging: 2-5 microns; NIRISS imaging: 0.8-5.0 microns.\n- Observation mode(s): Imaging\n- Number of observations: 80,000+\nProduct processing info:\n- Software and version: Aladin/Hipsgen v.11.025 and upwards\n- Input data processing pipeline: JWST Calibration Reference Data System (context 0913, associated to pipeline version 1.5.3); Data processing software (2022_2a); PRD version (PRDOPSSOC-055); and upwards.\n- Input data processing level: level 3 (*_i2d.fits)\n- Input data processing date: from July 2022 to present date\n- Input data retrieval date: from July 2022 to present date\n- Input data source: European JWST Archive (eJWST) \nISO\nA single HiPS map including all ISOCAM observations in all bands (png, jpeg, fits).

CR3 includes Spitzer data taken during commissioning and cryogenic operations, including calibration data\nGiven the richness and wide amplitude range of the Spitzer images it is difficult to produce one HiPS that allows the visualisation of both the bright galactic plane and fainter extragalactic regions, therefore we have produced both faint and bright HiPS for IRAC, where the cuts were set to optimise the visualisation of the extra-galactic regions for the HiPS with 'faint' in their name, and for the HiPS with 'bright' in their name, the cuts were set to optimise the visualisation of the Galactic plane. \n9 Spitzer HiPS have been created in total, these are the following:\nCreated: October 2018\nURL: http://skies.esac.esa.int/Spitzer/\nSpitzer cold SEIP IRAC134 color (a color HiPS that has been created by combining the following three HiPS: Spitzer cold SEIP IRAC1 bright, \u200bSpitzer cold SEIP IRAC3 bright and Spitzer cold SEIP IRAC1 bright).\nCreated: May 2018\nURL: http://skies.esac.esa.int/Spitzer/\nSpitzer cold SEIP IRAC1 bright\nSpitzer cold SEIP IRAC2 faint\nSpitzer cold SEIP IRAC3 faint\nSpitzer cold SEIP IRAC4 faint\nSpitzer cold SEIP IRAC1 bright\nSpitzer cold SEIP IRAC2 bright\nSpitzer cold SEIP IRAC3 bright\nSpitzer cold SEIP IRAC4 bright\nProduct info:\n- Instrument(s): IRAC\n- Band(s): IRAC 1, 2, 3 and 4: 3.6 microns, 4.5 microns, 5.8 microns, 8 microns\n- Observation mode(s): IRAC: Spitzer Enhanced Imaging Products (SEIP) Super Mosaics\n- Number of observations: IRAC1: 10949; IRAC2: 10944; IRAC3: 10946; IRAC4: 10949\nProduct processing info:\n- Software and version: Aladin/Hipsgen v.9.013 for single frequency HiPS;  Aladin/Hipsgen v.10.076 for color HiPS\n- Input data processing pipeline: Spitzer Super-Mosaic Pipeline\n- Input data processing date: 2012-09-28T13:49:52\n- Input data retrieval date: 2018-08\n- Input data source: https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/SPITZER/Enhanced/SEIP/images\nHERSCHEL\nHerschel HiPS maps including all mission public imaging observations in a single instrument/band and in several colour compositions of different bands and instruments.\nThe following maps are available:\n- PACS-70 (png, fits)\n- PACS-100 (png, fits)\n- PACS-160 (png, fits)\n- PACS colour (Red: 160; blue: 70) (png only)\n- PACS colour Galactic plane (Red: 160; blue: 70) (jpeg only)\n- SPIRE-250 (png, fits)\n- SPIRE-350 (png, fits)\n- SPIRE-500 (png, fits)\n- SPIRE colour (Red: 500; green: 350; blue: 250) (png only)\nCreated: September 2017\nURL: http://skies.esac.esa.int/Herschel/\nProduct info:\n- Instrument(s): PACS, SPIRE\n- Band(s): PACS 70 microns, 100 microns, 160 microns; SPIRE: 250 microns, 350 microns, 500 microns\n- Observation mode(s): PACS: scan mode, parallel mode; SPIRE: large map, small map, parallel mode\n- Number of observations: PACS-70: 4618; PACS-100: 4316; PACS-160: 8935; SPIRE: 5743 per band\nProduct processing info:\n- Software and version: Aladin/Hipsgen v.10 & v.8.165\n- Input data processing pipeline: HIPE v.14.1.0 (SPIRE), v14.2.0 & 14.2.1 (PACS) \n- Input data processing level: level 2.5/2.0\n- Input data processing date: 04 Sep 2017 (SPIRE), 28 Sep 2017 (PACS)\n- Input data retrieval date: Aug 2017\n- Input data source: Herschel Science Archive (HSA)\nNotes:\nIn the HiPS generation, the flux cut levels and intensity stretch for the Herschel HiPS are automatically selected for each individual image, and they may not be optimal for visualisation of the features in every image. To circumvent this problem, the data have been normalised using Herschel-optimised cuts and stretch prior to the HiPS generation. Even so, a few fields may not be correctly visualised: they appear either darker (underexposed) or brighter (overexposed). See the caveats section for more details on this problem.\nThe PACS colour Galactic Plane HiPS belongs to a previous set of Herschel HiPS where the above normalisation strategy was not applied. This map is optimal for the study of features in the Galactic Plane, but most extragalaxtic fields appear dark.\nThe available PACS HiPS only features observations with available level-2.5 products in the Herschel Science Archive. It will soon be replaced by an improved version including as well all observations with only level-2 products. For more information on the Herschel processing levels and products, see the corresponding documentation.\n\u200b\nPLANCK\nPlanck HiPS maps have been produced using the nine Planck 2015 total intensity maps (T: 30 - 857 GHz) and the six Planck 2015 polarized intensity maps (P: 30 - 353 GHz) for both LFI and HFI instruments. The polarized intensity maps (P) are not available in the PLA as such, and have been produced from the corresponding Stokes Q and U columns inside the frequency maps as follows: P = square_root(Stokes_Q^2 + Stokes_U^2). Since the polarization maps shown in ESASky have been produced for quick visualization of the Planck data, no bias correction has been applied. Please note that the polarized intensity maps have been smoothed with Gaussian kernels ranging from 30 arc minutes at 30 GHz to 10 arcminutes at 353 GHz.\nSimilarly, HiPS maps from two physical models derived from the Planck 2015 component separation (Commander solution) have been produced and can be found in the \"Others\" section of the HiPS skies panel. These two HiPS correspond to the polarized intensity dust model (nside=1024) and the polarized intensity low resolution synchrotron model (nside=256). As in the previous polarization maps, the dust and synchrotron polarized intensity maps needed to generate the HiPS have been produced as Commander_Dust_P=square_root(Commander_Dust_Stokes_Q^2 + Commander_Dust_Stokes_U^2), and Commander_Synchrotron_P=square_root(Commander_Synch_Stokes_Q^2 + Commander_Synch_Stokes_U^2), respectively. Please note that the Commander_Synchtrotron_P has been smoothed with a 40 arc-minute Gaussian kernel and the Commander_Dust_P has been smoothed with a 10 arc-minute Gaussian kernel..\nIMPORTANT: The Planck HiPS are meant for visualisation only.

They are not science-ready products and should not be used to perform scientific data analysis.\n\nThe all-sky views (HiPS) currently available on ESASky have some known caveats:\n\n - The current HiPS maps have fixed flux cuts and pixel intensity stretching for high and low intensities. As a consequence, if strong flux level differences exist between different observations, it is often not possible to find an automated way that would allow good static visualisation of all the data. For XMM-Newton and INTEGRAL, the scaling of the input data to the same background level provided a good representation of all the images in the HiPS. In other cases this approach did not work well and we proceeded with re-scaling of the standardised images based on the Planck flux scale (ISOCAM, AKARI, Herschel-SPIRE). This alternative processing was not successful for Herschel-PACS, where we implemented individual pixel cuts and stretching to each image before adding it to the HiPS all sky map.  There is still room for improvements and we are currently exploring more flexible scheme.\n\n - Herschel RGB HiPS maps: because of the way the Herschel images were standardised and stretched for the all sky HiPS maps, the pixel distribution does not have a physical meaning and as a consequence the RGB maps are not representative for the actual characteristics of the emitting regions (temperature). Even more difficult to produce is a representative RGB HiPS for PACS and SPIRE combined. That is why we do not provide such a HiPS map in this version. We are exploring alternative ways to produce meaningful RGB maps for Herschel for the next release.\n\n - HiPS from ongoing missions (HST, XMM-Newton, INTEGRAL) do not contain all the observational data available in the archives, but only the public data up to the HiPS map creation date indicated in the HiPS information page. These HiPS maps will be periodically replaced with newer ones adding more recent observations to the previous HiPS.\n\nInformation in connection with your use of the website, such as information in server logs, including information on how the website was used by you and your search queries.

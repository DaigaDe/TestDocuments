Modestas Sudnius   
Eleving Group CEO 

Keynote  from the CEO
General overview

Considering the challenging economic climate, we embarked on 2023 with cautious optimism. The year was expected to	be	defined	by	high	inflation, high	interest	rates,	and	 geopolitical turmoil, with possible adverse effects on Eleving Group. To mitigate the potential negative impacts, our main focus therefore was on portfolio quality, processes, cost efficiency,	and	diversification	of	our	funding	structure.	Also, decisions	related	to	mitigating the	negative	impact	of	FX	were not overlooked.

We	now	see	that,	after	slightly slower	first	few	months,	
our business gradually gathered momentum in the following period, with the Group recording the best-ever results at	the	end	of	the	year.	The	strong financial results were derived	from	a	well-diversified	business	structure,	accompanied by organic growth, and reinforced by the leading position of our subsidiaries in their respective markets. Also, our customer payment discipline remained strong thanks to our previously made decisions on tightening the Group’s underwriting policies and customer solvency checks. On top of that, the Group managed to successfully reduce the cost of risk, compared to the previous year. This was a year that was marked by corporate maturity and procedural quality.

Products and processes
Several notable developments occurred in the realm of products and processes. Firstly, integrating the consumer lending business in Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, and Lesotho (Sub-Saharan region countries)	significantly	broadened	the	Group’s	global	
footprint. This strategic move bolstered the Group’s net portfolio by approximately EUR 28 mln and paved the way for expansion into the Sub-Saharan region, with a tailored consumer product catering to public administration employees.

During the year, the company has also strengthened its position across the existing product mix while offering its customers an even better experience than before.  A few projects worth mentioning are the automation of mobile wallet (M-Kopa) statement analysis in Kenya, the launch of a second-generation customer cabinet in Romania, the launch of additional credit line functionality in Albania, and car auction functionality in KE and LT. All these projects were focused on improving customer experience and optimizing back-end processes.

Additionally, it’s worth highlighting the successful sale of the Renti+ business in Latvia. Once the company understood that developing such a product further would be more challenging in a peak interest rate environment, it quickly decided to sell the business and release resources to focus on developing the Group’s core products. In the	meantime,	OX	Drive	car-sharing	business	reached	a	revenue	of	EUR	1	mln	and	now	operates	a	fleet	of	more	than 150 electric cars.

Capital management
Eleving Group’s capital management strategy proved remarkably	effective	regarding	the	diversification	of	the	funding sources and alignment with sustainable business practices. One of the key events in 2023 was the issue of Eleving Group 2023/2028 senior secured and guaranteed bonds	in	the	amount	of	EUR	50	mln.	It	significantly	improved	the	Group’s	debt	maturity	profile,	helped	to	refinance	around	half	of	Mogo	AS	2021/2024	bonds	maturing on 31 March 2024, and attracted over 2000 new investors, mainly from the Baltics.

The Group’s collaboration with impact funds in 2023  resulted in lower funding costs and contributed to the boost	of	our	green	products,	exemplified	by	the	USD	7	
mln investment from Verdant Capital Hybrid Fund in the 
Kenyan portfolio. Furthermore, strategic partnerships with international	investment	funds	provided	flexibility
in meeting the needs of our subsidiaries, like in the case of Mogo Romania, where we laid a foundation for a EUR 
10 mln investment from ACP Credit that was received in early 2024. Additionally, despite slightly higher costs, the collaboration	with	Mintos	offered	flexibility	in	capital	raising,	
reflecting	Eleving	Group’s	commitment	to	adaptability	and	
responsiveness to market conditions.

In the near future, the company aims to continue to raise as much as possible in local currencies to cover most of the 
FX	fluctuations	and	minimize the	related	risks.

Modestas Sudnius  
Eleving Group CEO

This year, it was done by expanding the local note programs in Kenya and Botswana and attracting local bank financing.	Overall,	Eleving	Group’s	fundraising	strategy	in	
2023 underscored a balanced approach toward the cost of capital and funding objectives, setting a solid foundation for sustained growth in the future.

Sustainability
This year, we have strengthened our position in the green mobility market, as evidenced by growing customer interest in	our	electric	motorcycle	financing	solutions	in	Kenya	
and electric car-sharing services in Latvia. Although we currently hold a relatively small share of the Kenyan electric motorcycle	financing	market,	the	business	has	the	potential to grow tenfold in the coming years. Our projections originate from analyzing customers’ interest in more sustainable mobility and considering the recently introduced retrofitting	product,	which	enables	us	to	convert	used	
ICE	motorcycles	into	electric	ones,	significantly	extending their life cycle. We expect organic demand for this product already in 2024. In the meantime, the Group is preparing to	introduce	an	electric	motorcycle	financing	service	in Uganda. Our decisive action to promote green mobility has reduced the average CO2 intensity of the Group’s vehicle portfolio, bringing us closer to the Group’s climate goals.

To strengthen our climate mitigation actions, we have also implemented several carbon offsetting projects in Kenya and Ethiopia that helped us fully offset the carbon footprint of the Riga and Vilnius headquarters.

Meanwhile, in the social area, we are continuing our work on educating	consumers	on	financial	literacy	through	our	
interactive platform launched in early 2023 year. More than 
30,000 consumers globally have completed online self-assessment	and	evaluated	their	financial	health,	gaining	
valuable suggestions on managing their money more effectively. We have also contributed to local communities, 
for example, by educating motorcyclists on road safety in 
Kenya, taking part in environmental clean-up activities, 
promoting the well-being of employees and their families, 
and carrying out several charity campaigns.

Summary
To wrap up, this year has presented its fair share of challenges, yet it has been successful for our company.

We have witnessed solid growth, made prudent decisions that	delivered	the	expected	outcomes,	and	fortified	our	
financial	position	to	ensure	long-term	growth	of	our	global	
operations. As we turn our focus to 2024, we anticipate new opportunities for expansion and accelerated growth, 
bringing	positive	news	and	significant	developments	for	our	
investors' and partners' community.

Taxonomy eligibility

The EU Taxonomy regulation is a classification system of environmentally sustainable economic activities.1 The regulation aims to direct capital flows towards projects and activities that contribute to at least one of the EU’s six environmental objectives:

1. Climate change mitigation.

2. Climate change adaptation.

3. The sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources.

4. The transition to a circular economy.

5. Pollution prevention and control

6. The protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.

Companies within the scope of the Non-Financial Reporting
Directive (NFRD)2 must disclose taxonomy-related information following the methodology and implementation timeframe of the disclosure obligation as specified in the
Disclosures Delegated Act.3 In the 2022 annual report, Eleving Group will disclose information regarding its exposures to taxonomy-eligible and non-eligible activities in line with article 10(2) of the Disclosures Delegated Act. Currently, the eligible activities concern the first two objectives of the Taxonomy regulation: climate change mitigation and adaptation. 4

Taxonomy Mandatory Reporting

Eleving Group’s exposures to taxonomy-eligible activities comprise leases for vehicles, loans backed by vehicles, and used vehicle rental services. These loans directly relate to activities that fit the description of section 6.5 of the Climate Delegated Act Annex I: Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars, and light commercial vehicles.1 The exposures to taxonomy-non-eligible activities include unsecured consumer loans, vehicle loans granted outside the EU, and loans to companies not subject to the disclosure obligations under the NFRD.

Eleving Group has set targets to reduce the climate impact of its portfolio related to these activities (see section Striving for climate impact reduction and adaptation). These climate targets relate to product design and engagement with clients. However, these targets are not considered in compliance with the Taxonomy regulation because it is currently difficult to estimate the availability and accessibility of information required to demonstrate that Eleving Group financing activities are taxonomy-aligned. This approach will be reviewed in the coming years, pending the feasibility of proving alignment.


Required information (art 10(2)):

Absolute sum:

Exposures to Taxonomy-eligible activities: 84,292,629
Exposures to Taxonomy-non-eligible activities: 337,325,869

Business lines

Eleving Group runs two business lines: vehicle finance and consumer finance. In the vehicle finance segment, the Group offers vehicle leasing, leaseback, subscription, rental, rent-to-buy, and car-sharing products. In the consumer products segment, the Group offers single payment and installment loans, credit lines, and long-term unsecured loans.

The Group provides vehicle financing products in ten markets—Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Georgia, Romania, Moldova, Armenia, Uganda, Kenya, and Uzbekistan. In the consumer financing segment, the Group is present in seven markets – Albania, Moldova, North Macedonia, and the newly integrated Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, and Lesotho.

The Group’s business lines comprise several products and services that fill the funding gap and create new opportunities for people who previously did not have access to finance or private means of transport. The Group’s main
products can be split into three categories:

Lease and leaseback products  in Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Georgia, Romania, Armenia, Moldova, Uzbekistan, Kenya, and Uganda.

Flexible lease and subscription-based products  — motorcycle taxis in Kenya and Uganda, used vehicle rental in Latvia and Lithuania, and electric car-sharing in Latvia.

Consumer lending products  — installment loans, credit lines, single payment loans in Albania, Moldova, and North Macedonia, and long-term consumer loans for public administration employees in Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, and Lesotho.


#### pg:12

Eleving Vehicle Finance offers a finance lease and leaseback to customers in all its countries of operation. Under a finance lease, Eleving Group purchases a customer-selected vehicle; the lessee can then use the vehicle during the lease period and pay a series of installments. The purchased vehicles are 1 to 23 years old, with the majority in the range of 12 to 18 years. After repaying the principal, the lessee becomes the vehicle’s legal owner. Under a leaseback contract, Eleving Group purchases a vehicle directly from the customer; the customer then continues to use the vehicle and pays monthly installments. After repaying the principal, the customer again becomes the vehicle’s legal owner.


The finance lease and leaseback are Eleving Group’s core products and currently represent 45.8% of the total net loan portfolio as at 31 December 2023. Eleving
Group also offers multiple flexible lease and subscription-based products, accounting for 21.4% of the portfolio.

In Lithuania, the Group offers rent-to-buy solutions to customers looking for maximum flexibility, allowing them to return or exchange the vehicle any time. In Eastern
Africa, the company provides productive lending for new motorcycles and three-wheelers for passenger transport or delivery of goods. These lending products specifically target self-employed riders and small entrepreneurs who rely on their motorcycles to generate income and support their families. During the year, the Group also launched a new initiative in Kenya—retrofitting internal combustion engine
motorcycles to electric ones. The main objective of this product is to further the introduction of sustainable mobility in Kenya and to give a second life to used motorcycles,
thereby extending their life cycle.


Mogo is the dominant brand in the used vehicle finance segment. Services are delivered through websites, mobile platforms, and an extensive network of dealers, brokers, and branches. In certain markets, the Group extends its offering to include rent-to-buy solutions, motorcycle subscription services, and financing for higher-end vehicles through strategic partnerships with local banks, primarily under the Primero brand. In 2022, the Group expanded its product range to include the car-sharing service OX Drive. This is an app through which an electric car-sharing service is offered in Riga and other nearby cities. As of 31 December 2023, 139 Tesla cars of several models under the OX Drive brand provide a high-end and eco-friendly  mobility experience for people who need a car for short distances and periods. Eleving Vehicle Finance’s business model capitalizes on the growing global demand for mobility and high-quality used vehicles in the Group’s markets. This model is implemented through an innovative, data-driven, and rapid process, supported by strategic IT investments, robust controls, effective debt collection, and direct collaborations with used car dealer networks. The emphasis on secured lending against vehicle titles has enabled Eleving Group to carve out a unique niche in the financial services market, positioning itself as a pioneer with distinct advantages in economies of scale. Before the establishment of Mogo in 2012, there was no convenient financing alternative for used vehicles older than five years in the Baltic region.


Eleving’s Consumer Finance business focuses on markets lacking financial inclusion and having communities underserved by conventional financial institutions. There is usually no “middle ground” between difficult-to-access bank finance and very limited, expensive short-term loans. Eleving Consumer Finance companies are often the only lenders offering online and offline customer service experiences for diverse customer groups. With over 160 branches in Moldova, North Macedonia, Albania, Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, and Lesotho, Eleving Consumer Finance companies offer flexible financial products—from credit lines to installment loans, providing access to substantial funds to customers that meet the Group's credit assessment benchmarks.

## Stakeholders

Eleving Group believes a stakeholder-based approach helps to understand and manage both opportunities and risks to ensure sustainable	growth	and	profitability;	therefore,	the	
Group focuses on bringing value to its stakeholders:

 Employees: career advancement and personal satisfaction.

 Customers: enabled upward social mobility through financial inclusion	across	diverse	communities.	

  Investors: return on the allocated capital.

 Regulators: a reliable partner in shaping the industry; a transparent and compliant entity.

 Local economies: regular tax revenues, a well-paid and educated workforce, and a non-discriminating attitude from an international employer.

 The industry: a trend and standard setter that drives innovation.

Eleving Group earns a substantial majority of its revenues from interest payments and fees on the Group’s loans to customers. Financial institutions and other funding sources provide the Group with capital to fund these loans and charge interest on funds that Eleving Group draws down.

- Investors

Eleving Group’s investor community comprises retail and institutional investors. In the retail segment, the Group has over 2000 investors from the Baltic states and Germany and over 10,000 Mintos investors from around 62 countries.

In the institutional investor segment, we have three sub-groups:

 * Bondholders—hedge	funds,	family	offices,	wealthy	
private investors.

 * Baltic banks, Southern European banks, etc. 

 * Sustainability-oriented funds with a focus on the Africa region.

Our investors value the Group as a trusted partner that can deliver consistent and sustainable growth.

- External partners

The Group relies on certain services provided by third parties, such as banks, local consumer credit agencies, IT service providers, and debt-collection agencies. An inability to maintain existing business relationships with them and other third-party providers or the failure by these third-party providers to maintain the quality of their services or otherwise provide their services to the Group may have a material	adverse	effect	on	the	Group’s	business,	financial	
position,	operational	results,	prospects,	or cash flows.

- Clients

The typical client of Eleving Group mobility products is a working-class person who frequently uses a vehicle for daily commuting and as an instrument to make a living for them and their family. It is a person looking for a convenient	and	easy-to-understand	financial product	with fast onboarding and simple use. Customers of Eleving Group’s Vehicle Finance prefer to drive used premium-class vehicles since such vehicles perform better, depreciate less and have cheaper maintenance costs due to a well-developed aftermarket. For most customers, a car is not a nice-to-have item but a necessity to travel to their workplace or earn income. The Group also serves small and medium	enterprises	that need quick	financial solutions	to solve mobility issues in their businesses. Most of Eleving Group’s Vehicle Finance customers are males aged 21 to 59. A	significant	part	of	used	car	sales	occurs	at	physical locations where potential customers can see and test a car while interacting with a seller directly. Because of this trend, Eleving Group introduced dedicated partner account managers	and	specific	partner	programs	to	establish	close	
business relationships with used car sellers.

Consequently, in 2021, the Group initiated its sustainability reporting initiative, employing the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) framework. This ensures that key stakeholders receive pertinent information for making well-informed decisions regarding the Group’s capacity to generate value over the short, medium, and long term. Eleving Group considers ESG data a significant performance indicator for all primary stakeholders and society. As a result, in 2021, the Group commenced a seamless transition to a regular and strategically guided sustainability reporting process.

## Climate change mitigation and adaption

The global economy must undergo system-wide change to keep global warming under two degrees. Eleving Group	takes an active	role within	its	sphere of influence	to promote the pursuit of a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy, focusing on low-emission mobility.

Climate change is already an important strategic consideration for Eleving Group. Eleving Group acknowledges that not only does climate change have an	impact	on	its	own	business, but the Group’s financing	decisions can also facilitate the transition to low-carbon, sustainable societies. Eleving Group is committed to implementing decarbonization measures in line with the Paris Agreement and reducing its environmental footprint in the coming years through product-related activities, such	as	launching	electric	car	sharing	and	offering financial incentives (discounts) for ‘green’ vehicles.

Climate change mitigation and adaptation are included as a priority area in Eleving Group’s Strategic ESG 
Program 2022-2025, developed in 2021, and the Group’s management has set the following goals:

 Measure CO2 intensity (average g CO2 /km tailpipe emissions), report transparently, and reduce the CO2 
emissions intensity	of	the	funded	fleet	annually.
 Educate customers and society about CO2 emissions intensity and provide incentives to move to green mobility vehicles.
 Reach climate neutrality of the administrative operations by 2025.

In 2023, Eleving Group took several strategic actions to meet these commitments to promote green mobility. The Group	continued	to	expand	its	e-boda	financing	service	in	
Kenya, while in Latvia, an electric car-sharing service under the	OX	Drive	brand	was	rolled	out	further. In	2023,	the	
Group’s clients commuted around 3.2 mln kilometers on pure electricity. In addition, in Q4, the Group’s subsidiary, 
Mogo	Kenya,	launched	a	motorcycle	retrofitting	service. It’s an opportunity to swap the engine of one’s fuel-based motorcycle for a battery, turning it into an electric motorcycle and extending its life cycle. The Group also educates its customers on more sustainable decisions through daily communication—it has introduced a CO2 
metric on all Eleving Group sales portals, thus promoting eco cars to all customers visiting the websites. By providing new and environmentally friendly products and educating customers, in 2023, the Group reduced the average CO2 
intensity arising from its car portfolio by 4%.

## Vehicle	finance	portfolio climate impact 

As part of its ESG proposition, Eleving Group is committed to actively shaping the transition to a low-carbon economy and mobility. This will be achieved by fostering green mobility among customers—by offering new green products and raising customer awareness of sustainable consumption, thus encouraging them to make more sustainable choices.

Eleving Group has set the reduction of CO2 intensity of its funded	fleet	as	the	primary	goal	in	the	Strategic	ESG	Program	2022–2025. The Group intends to reach its ambitions by promoting	green	vehicle	financing	and	focusing	on	productive	lending	(see section Fostering responsible	access	to	finance).

To assess the current climate impact of the Group’s portfolio, 
a CO2 calculation methodology was developed internally in 
2022. After exploring different approaches and available data sources, it was decided to use the database of the 
Road Traffic Safety	Directorate	of	Latvia	(hereinafter CSDD	
(Latvian abbreviation)). The database was compared with the European Environment Agency’s (EEA) CO2 emissions calculations for new passenger cars, and the results were very similar. Since the CSDD database covers the period of 
2004–2020 as opposed to EEA’s 2010+, it was decided that the CSDD database will provide better coverage.

In the CSDD database for 2004-2020, the New European 
Driving Cycle (NEDC) method was used, but starting from 
2021-2022, the method was changed to the Worldwide 
Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) developed by the European Union. Since the WLTP method gives slightly higher CO2 emission results, the impact of the methodology change should be estimated before it can be used in calculations.

The CSDD database contains data on vehicle fuel type, 
year, engine capacity, transmission type, brand, and model. Since the nature of the data on Eleving Group’s side did not correspond to that of CSDD and to avoid manual monitoring of all current entries in the Group’s database, it was decided to group the data by: 
 vehicle year
 fuel type
 engine capacity  

For each vehicle matching the group, the average CO2 con-sumption from the CSDD database was used. For vehicles that did not match the group, exception rules were created:

 Boda-boda’s (motorbike taxis in Kenya and Uganda) 
formed 56.2% (count-wise) of loans in the Group’s vehicle	finance	portfolio in 2023. Their emissions have been estimated at 40g per km used. The International Council on Clean Transportation suggested using 21-35g per km for boda boda, but according to Ecoscore, the estimated consumption is 1.8l/100km: 1.81L/100km*2392g=43g per km and 
1.61L/100km*2392g=39g per km.

 Electric cars produce 70-75% fewer grams of CO2 per km compared to traditional vehicles, and they formed 
0.17% of Eleving Vehicle finance loans in 2022.

 Cars manufactured before 2004 formed 8.6% of loans in 2023. Since no accurate data were available for this period, average data from the CSDD database of 
2004 by fuel type and engine capacity was used in calculations.

## Direct environmental impact 

### Carbon-neutral company

Although the Group’s main climate impact arises from its portfolio, Eleving Group aims to become climate-neutral in its administrative operations by 2025, and it continuously works on maintaining high environmental standards in all its	offices.

To pursue climate impact mitigation, the Group started tracking its carbon footprint in 2021—a carbon footprint assessment was introduced at Eleving Group’s headquarters.

According to an assessment carried out in 2021 by Carbon 
Footprint Ltd, the Group’s HQs in Riga and Vilnius generate 
114 t CO2 annually. To offset the carbon footprint arising from the HQ operations, Eleving Group participated in carbon offsetting projects in Kenya and Ethiopia. For the consecutive year, the Group co-financed	the	reforestation of the Great Rift	Valley	in	Kenya,	while for the first	time, it participated in the Northern Ethiopia Community Safe Water project, aiming to provide clean water to local communities of Amhara National Regional State.

The Group is committed to reducing the climate impact of	its	HQ	through	energy	efficiency	and	using	renewable	
energy Group-wide. By 2025, 100% of all Eleving Group’s offices,	where	suppliers	can	be	selected,	will	use	renewable energy.

Eleving Group HQ is based in Riga, Latvia, in Skanstes City, 
a brand-new multifunctional business district, one of only a	few	BREEAM	In-Use	certified	office	complexes	in	Latvia.	
BRE Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) is an environmental	certification	system	from	the	UK. Developed in 1990,	it	is	one	of	the	oldest	environmental	certification systems used to certify buildings. This is the most widely used system in Europe.

*Carbon footprint standard | Carbon Neutral Oranisation*

### Modern office

Modern	offices, developed	infrastructure,	and	sustainability	
was among the top reasons for the Group to choose 
Skanstes City. At the end	of	2020,	Eleving	Group’s	office	
was	certified	as	an	energy-efficient	workplace,	receiving the BREEAM In-Use assessment of “Very Good,” an upgrade from the sustainability assessment of “Good.” Group`s premises, the water usage is kept in check across all offices.

Also, significant	investments	were	made	into modernizing the ventilation systems, making technical upgrades, and improving the HQ’s public spaces, accessibility, and cycling infrastructure. After renovation, it became one of Riga’s most modern	and	sustainable	office	buildings	in	its	class. Eleving Group is committed to keeping other environmental impacts of	its	offices	to	a	bare	minimum: reducing paper, water, waste, and other resource consumption intensity Group-wide.

While the Group’s focus is placed on reducing resource consumption, waste reduction and recycling are also considered. The Group`s HQ has already implemented a range of waste optimization initiatives, such as a zero-paper policy and reducing plastic waste. A deposit waste collection system has	been introduced	in	the	Riga and Vilnius offices since 2022.

To provide Eleving Group’s HQ staff with fresh and clean drinking	water,	the	office	is	equipped	with	water dispensers to save water and reduce plastic waste. By using an average of 1.94 m3/m2 of water in 2021 at all Group`s premises, the water usage is kept in check across all offices.

## Office initiatives

Eleving Group understands the importance of protecting the environment and is committed to ensuring that the company is doing its part to reduce the environmental impact arising from its business. Almost every month, an activity is carried out at the Group level to raise employee awareness of sustainable alternatives to various daily habits. For example, the Group’s HQ regularly educates employees on reducing resource consumption in internal seminars and through announcements on internal TV screens	at	the	offices. The	Group	actively	participates	in	the Earth Hour campaign, and during the warmer months, it promotes bicycles as an alternative mobility solution to cars. One month every year is dedicated to climate topics, and relevant activities are carried out. Since late 2023, the Group has introduced an internal monitoring of resource usage that helps track:

 Monthly energy consumption (electricity), MWh/m2.

 Monthly energy consumption (electricity), MWh/employee.

 Monthly energy consumption (electricity), MWh in total.

 Monthly paper consumption, t.

 Water consumption, m3.

 Water consumption, m3/employee.

 Waste generation, t.

 Waste generation, t/employee.

 Recycled waste, t in total. 

It is planned that throughout 2024, Eleving Group and its subsidiaries will monitor resource usage to reduce consumption levels; therefore, several internal activities will be carried out, and the progress report will be published in 
2024.

### Ensuring employees’ growth and well-being

Eleving Group has always stood up for fair pay and social and health guarantees. The Group rewards employees based on their performance and contribution to the company while considering factors like location and cost of living. Employees are also provided with competitive benefits	packages	an are	encouraged	to	use	development	opportunities offered by the company.

Eleving Group believes a fair and transparent tax system is vital to a well-functioning society. The Group pays maximum attention to all tax-related procedures, complying with local and international legislation, legal requirements, and acceptable business standards. This especially applies to labor taxes, where the Group maintains a rigorous tax discipline.

## Diverse and inclusive workplace 

Eleving Group employs people of various cultural backgrounds, genders, and ages. The Group is represented by people coming from over 20 different nations. Therefore, diversity and equal opportunities are essential to Eleving Group’s human resources strategy.

The Group ensures that employees are treated fairly and are provided with equal opportunities. Eleving Group is committed to creating and maintaining an open, inclusive work environment free from discrimination and harassment. No one, internal employees or external candidates, should feel discriminated against or harassed in recruitment, promotion, or employment processes.

## Non-Discrimination Policy

Managing a diverse and flexible workforce with	the	right	
competencies is vital to ensuring quality, innovation, and growth. The Group’s Equality, Inclusion, and Non-Discrimination Policy is enforced at all Eleving Group companies.

The Group’s Equality, Inclusion, and Non-Discrimination 
Policy sets out the following principles:

 Equality—all humans are born equal. Therefore, equal treatment of all individuals, regardless of ethnicity, 
cultural background, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, disability, age, or other factors, is our overriding priority.

 Zero-tolerance against discrimination, harassment, 
sexual harassment, and victimization.

 Respect for individual differences concerning ethnicity, 
sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, culture, 
religion, and other factors.

This policy applies to the Group`s management, employees, 
agency workers, contractors, business partners, and suppliers.

The policy applies to all work-related activities, including but not limited to recruitment and selection, conditions and benefits,	training	and	promotion,	task	allocation,	shifts,	
hours, leave arrangements, workload, equipment, as well as interpersonal relationships at work, related situations such as travel, events, and after-work gatherings.

To ensure full compliance and adherence to the policy throughout the Group, continuous work is being done to raise employee awareness of diversity issues.

Anita Kalnina, Group Chief Human Resources Officer:
"At Eleving Group, we aim to establish a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere, ensuring that all individuals are valued and treated with respect. Our team’s diversity enriches our collective knowledge and collaboration, driving us towards achieving our objectives. We cultivate an environment that promotes both personal development and career advancement."

In September 2021, Eleving Group voluntarily joined the Latvian Diversity Charter. It contains 15 commitments promoting diversity in workplaces around Latvia. By signing the Diversity Charter, the Group commits to promoting diversity and equal opportunities for its staff.

According to Fontes, a Baltic human resources consultancy	firm, the ratio	of women to	men	in	the	financial	services	sector is 66% to 34%. Eleving Group’s gender diversity ratio stands at 54% women to 46% men across all positions as of the end of 2023.

Gender diversity in the Group and among senior roles is measured monthly. As of 31 December 2023, the ratio of women to men in entry-to-mid-level positions was 55% to 45%, respectively, while in senior-level positions, the ratio was 45% to 55%.

Eleving Group has a grievance mechanism in place— 
employees can report harassment and discrimination incidents directly to their local human resources representative or global human resources. There is also a TrustLine, Eleving Group’s whistleblowing tool, to be used as a reporting tool if (i) an incident concerns persons in leading positions and (ii) it concerns severe cases of discrimination or harassment.

## Family-friendly workplace

The	Group offers its staff several fringe benefits to foster	
an inclusive working environment. Among other things, Eleving Group focuses on solutions that prevent working parents from choosing between career and family. Eleving 
Group provides working parents with a support package that includes a room designated for children at the company office, flexible working hours, additional leave according to the company’s internal policies, and professional childcare service once a year for three weeks in July at the company’s HQ. Eleving Group has also developed and implemented a re-onboarding plan for colleagues returning from parental leave. The plan aims to promote a smoother return to the work environment, design an adapted work schedule for the first month of	return,	and	determine the duties of direct managers during the reintegration process. In 2021, Eleving Group was named a Family-Friendly Workplace. To earn this title, an employer has to facilitate measures to reconcile work and family life.

The Family-Friendly Workplace program is run by the 
Society Integration Foundation of Latvia, and its goal is to promote a family-friendly work environment in Latvia and to increase public awareness. Involvement in the Family-Friendly Workplace program motivates companies to introduce new solutions to enhance the well-being of working parents. In addition, the program provides an excellent opportunity to draw inspiration from other program participants and inspire change for those Latvian companies that are still considering joining the program.

## Personal growth and development 

One of Eleving Group’s main goals is talent attraction, 
development, and retention. The Group is committed to helping employees realize their full potential at every stage of their careers. The Group’s Personnel Management Policy aims to develop skilled and highly productive staff that successfully perform their duties.

Many senior management team members possess significant experience	in	the	lending	industry and knowledge of the regulatory and legal environment in the Group’s markets. The senior	management	would	be	difficult to replace. The	market	for	qualified individuals is highly	competitive, and labor costs for hiring and training new employees are increasing.

In 2023, all C-level executives, senior managers, and country managers who had been with the company for more than one year received 360-degree feedback. Managers	were	assessed	on	their	fit	for	the	manager	role—being trustworthy, visionary, a strategist, a good coach who develops the potential of subordinates, etc. To ensure an accurate employee evaluation process and interpretation of the results, a management training on Feedback 360 
was organized, providing tips on how to read the results and manage the feedback conversation. In 2023, all HQ 
staff received performance appraisals, and 98% received development interviews. 

In 2023, Eleving Group promoted 250 staff members (121 
in Eleving Vehicle Finance and 129 in Eleving Consumer 
Finance). Whenever possible, rather than searching for external talent, the Group seeks to promote employees capable of taking on new roles.

The Group has developed a comprehensive training program that provides internal and external professional training for employees at all levels. In 2023, 434 educational sessions were conducted across the Group, raising employees’ competence and knowledge in work-related and emotional balance areas. In addition, at the end of the year, it was decided that for HQ employees, from now on, part of the performance and bonus system will be linked to educational OKR, i.e., each employee will have one OKR per quarter linked to education and the minimum number of hours per quarter that must be spent on educational seminars, conferences, courses or self-education projects will be 8 hours.

Employee engagement and satisfaction are partially measured through Eleway Pulse, an employee survey conducted twice a year—in April and September. In 2022, 
the Group streamlined its internal employee survey based on the principles of Gallup’s Q12 employee engagement survey. In 2023, the average response rate equaled 87%.

35


#### pg:35

To measure employee satisfaction and loyalty, Eleving 
Group uses the Employer Net Promoter Score (eNPS) 
scoring system. In 2023, the score was 36.0, compared to 51.0 in 2022. The e NPS scores can range from +100 
(mainly promoters) to -100 (mostly detractors); therefore, 
the score of Eleving Group in 2023 can still be considered healthy. Given the decline in performance, the Group in 
2024 is committed to focusing more on the listed areas:

 Learning and development - more tailored for the individual	needs of employees and	the	job	specifics.

 Goal setting – more transparency in the goal setting, 
with clarification of employee	roles,	impact	on	the	
results, and outcomes.

 Leadership – upskilling leadership and social skills through individual or group sessions.

 Talent management - succession planning and growth to prepare robust, well-educated, and informed talents.


## Employee’ well-being strategy

Employee health, safety, and well-being have always been important to Eleving Group. Nevertheless, it was the COVID-19 pandemic that gave prominence to mental health, work-life balance, and employee well-being in the Group.

Eleving Group is committed to creating a safe working environment in all its countries. Compliance with local laws, adherence to the Group’s Global Policy and Standards, and working towards health and safety objectives are all essential components of the Group’s efforts to reduce risks and improve its health and safety record.

Workplace safety risks and hazards are prevented by implementing proper measures. First, as the law requires, workplace risks are assessed within the labor protection management system framework provided by FN Serviss, a workplace safety expert. All employees are regularly instructed on general	work safety	and	during test fire	alarms.	At employee onboarding and annually, employees are provided with information, instructions, and training to work safely and take steps to protect themselves from hazards. In 2023, the Group registered 57 recordable injuries among employees, compared to 76 a year ago. Out of 57 injuries, 35% were minor, 61% were medium, while two recorded cases in Uganda were lethal. Injuries were related to workers performing duties with motorcycle taxis in Kenya	and	Uganda—either during field debt collections, boda-boda	verification, or GPS Tracker installation. No injuries were recorded in other markets.

In addition, everyone must perform a compulsory health check with a certain regularity. Eleving Group’s employees are provided with annual health insurance, which allows using a wide range of health services (laboratory tests, hospital and ambulatory services, dentistry, psychological therapy, and physiotherapy).

#### pg:36

In 2023, Eleving Group spent around EUR 0.7 mln on health insurance coverage for employees, recording an increase in insurance budget by 17%, compared to 2022.

A healthy and active lifestyle is promoted and supported daily at Eleving Group. In addition to the safety instructions and training required by law, Eleving Group also provides employees with various types of informative training and activities to improve their well-being and health:

 Seminars on healthy eating, mental health, managing emotions, and maintaining psychological balance in a dynamic work environment.

 First aid training.

 Company-paid weekly yoga classes for the HQ 
employees.

 Company-paid volleyball training for the HQ employees.

 Collective initiatives to promote physical activity during the summer months.

 Gym coverage and swimming sessions via a health insurance policy.

## Future talents 

The future success of Eleving Group also depends on the company’s	ability	to	find and cultivate new	talent.	Eleving	
Group strives to help its staff grow by increasing their knowledge and experience.

In 2023, Eleving Group continued its internship program to provide	the	first	professional	experience	to	young	people studying and starting their careers. In 2023, 91 students began internships in different departments and functions across the Group’s countries. 

At the same time, cooperation with the Stockholm School of Economics in Riga, the leading business school in the Baltic region, continued. The cooperation included the Executive School, where the Group’s CEO, Modestas Sudnius, educated students and experienced professionals in business management, innovation, market research, and many more.

## Fostering responsible access	to finance

Helping	our	customers	make the	right	financial	decisions lies at the core of the Eleving Group business. By generating	stable	financial	returns	for	investors	and	providing	access to innovative and sustainable financial	solutions,	Eleving Group	seeks	to	make a significant	social and economic impact. In the coming years, the Group is committed not only to working hard to maintain a culture that treats the Group’s customers fairly but also to improving	financial	literacy	in all markets	where	it	operates. Eleving Group’s corporate strategy is focused on impact-making. By serving communities that conventional lenders underserve, Eleving Group brings disruptive change to the financial industry. By providing financial inclusion,	the	Group improves people’s lives worldwide. The Group’s ultimate purpose is to empower diverse communities worldwide	by	providing them with	financial inclusion—thus enabling upward social mobility.

The Group’s products are designed to offer customers simplicity, convenience, and transparency. Our online and offline	products are designed to protect	our	customers’	
privacy, provide easy access to funding, and offer transparent fee	and	interest	structures.	A finance	lease and leaseback are long-term loans (up to 84 months), while consumer loans are both short-term and long-term, with maturities ranging from 7 days to 48 months. For all products, customers are charged nominal interest and fees payable monthly on the outstanding principal amount. While penalty interests are charged for late loan payments, this is a minimal proportion of the Group’s income and shows the resilience of its customer base.

## Productive lending

Access	to	suitable	and	lasting	financial	services	empowers economically disadvantaged individuals to boost their earnings, accumulate assets, and mitigate risks from external challenges. Eleving Group has revolutionized the pre-owned	vehicle	market	by	offering	financial	solutions	
to individuals with limited access to capital. In 2021, Mogo,	the	flagship	brand	within	the	Group,	embarked	on	
an innovative approach by extending productive lending services in emerging economies. Productive lending entails funding vehicles for customers to generate income or enhance earnings from their existing enterprises. This primarily	involves	financing	boda-bodas	(motorcycle	taxis) and tuk-tuks (three-wheel taxis) in Kenya and Uganda.

A boda-boda is a small motorcycle widely used in Kenya for taxi services and cargo deliveries. It is estimated that the boda-boda industry provides over 1.5+ million jobs, 
which support another 6+ million Kenyans’ (more than 11% of the population) livelihood. An estimated 60% of the	motorcycles	in	Kenya	are	rented	to	the	riders	by	fleet	
owners, not allowing the average rider to own the asset. With a Mogo lease, riders can pay similar or even lower monthly instalments compared to renting the motorcycle, 
and they will own it after the loan is repaid.Since its launch in Kenya, Eleving Group has contributed to the economic inclusion and small business development of more than 93,500 boda-boda riders. Boda-bodas account for around 56% of the company’s vehicle portfolio.

In	2023	Mogo	launched	financing	for	electric	motorcycles	to facilitate the adoption EVs. As of 1Q 2024, around 400 electric	motorcycles	were	financed	by	Mogo in	Kenya.	It is intended to achieve at least 10x in absolute numbers in 2024 by further rolling out the product in Kenya and launching it in Uganda. In addition, the launch of a	motorcycle	retrofitting service	was	carried	out	in	4Q	
2023. It is an opportunity to swap the engine of a fuel-based motorcycle for a battery, turning it into an electric motorcycle and extending its life cycle. Since the product launch at the end of 2023, several customers have already been	funded	to retrofit	their	motorcycles. It	is	estimated	 that this solution can save the customer up to USD 632 a year as compared to a regular ICE bike.

Therefore, over 20% of the Group’s portfolio serves the self-employed and SMEs, thereby increasing economic inclusion and the prosperity of local communities.

The rationale behind promoting electric mobility in Kenya
  Small entrepreneurs, by using Mogo Kenya’s product, 
enjoy cheaper operating and lower maintenance costs, 
which increases their level of income from doing their business.

 Financing electric motorcycles contributes to reducing 
CO2 emissions and noise levels in urban areas where internal combustion engine-powered vehicles still dominate.

 By reducing air pollution, electric vehicles can contribute to better public health outcomes, decreasing respiratory illnesses and related healthcare costs.

 Promoting electric mobility can create new economic opportunities, including manufacturing, maintenance, 
and charging infrastructure development. This can stimulate the labor market and support local businesses.

 Embracing electric mobility allows Kenya to leapfrog traditional automotive development stages and move directly to cleaner and more advanced technologies. This positions the country at the forefront of technological innovation.

 General social impact by educating the local community about sustainability, climate issues, and ways to reduce the negative environmental impact of our daily commuting habits.

 It’s an	opportunity	to	significantly	extend	the	life	span of	the motorcycle.

## Responsible lending 

Responsible and productive lending promoting economic inclusion lies at the core of Eleving Group’s operations in the mobility and consumer segments.

Eleving Group and its subsidiaries always fully comply with the local regulatory institutions (Financial Services 
Supervisory authorities, Central Banks, Consumer Right 
Protection authorities, and/or Ministries of Finance/Economy). 

Eleving Group also follows its internal standards on responsible lending and fair treatment; one of the fundamental principles of these standards is transparency. Eleving Group ensures that all the relevant information, including fees, key terms and conditions, legal documentation, and advertising, is clear, understandable, and accessible to clients.

Eleving Group has two main business lines: secured lending via	a	finance	lease	and	leaseback	against	the	title	of	the vehicle and unsecured consumer lending. The Group’s core focus stays on secured lending, which comprises more than 67% of the consolidated net loan portfolio as of 31 
December 2023.

Consumer loans issued by Eleving Group are primarily used for everyday expenses or purchasing consumer goods and electronics. Eleving Group provides consumers with easy access	to	finance	since	it	has	both-	a	brick-and-mortar	and	online presence.

Once customers apply for a loan, their creditworthiness is determined through a sophisticated underwriting process that relies on data-driven statistical analysis as captured in 
Eleving	Group’s	proprietary	vehicle	and	consumer finance	
scoring models.

Across all its products, Eleving Group analyses customers’ 
creditworthiness utilizing public and private databases 
(vehicle register information, databases of government institutions, debt collection agency databases, industry/peer company blacklists, and bank statement providers) and allocates a scoring band to each customer. The automated scoring models are developed in-house and, depending on the relevant country, are either integrated into the customer relationship management systems or run on third-party cloud solutions.

Each loan application undergoes the following steps:

1. Loan application processing and preliminary assessment.

2. Risk assessment and scoring.

3.	Vehicle	inspection	(for	finance	lease	and	leaseback	products)	and	finalization	of	loan	terms.	
4. Loan approval and disbursement of funds.

This allows Eleving Group to assess counterparty risk properly. The approval rate is exceptionally rigorous: in the 12-month period from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 
2023, of around 1,000,000 unique client loan applications, 
Eleving Group has kept an approval rate of 18.3% for vehicle	finance	and	37.2%	for	consumer	finance.

Eleving Group seeks to work with an educated and informed customer; therefore, particular focus is placed on educating customers	on	financial	literacy	and	promoting sustainable	and climate-friendly decision-making.

## Increasing financial literacy	

The Group aims to contribute to building a prosperous and sustainable society and supports various social initiatives helping local communities. Eleving Group is committed to fostering	financial	literacy	in	society.

In 2022, Eleving Group developed www.smart.eleving.com,	a	financial	literacy	platform	where	anyone	can	assess	
the health of their existing loan commitments, determine whether new	financial	commitments	would	be	feasible	
within	their	current	budget,	and	find	bits	of	advice	on	
budgeting,	debt	management,	saving,	financial	hygiene,	
and much more.

As of 31 December 2023, the platform is up and running in Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Romania, Moldova, Georgia, 
Armenia, Albania, Kenya, and Uganda. The platform will be localized in North Macedonia, Uzbekistan, Botswana, 
Namibia, Zambia, and Lesotho in 2024. Over 30,000 
unique consumers have taken the self-assessment, with the vast majority from Kenya, Tanzania, and Latvia. Launching	a	financial	literacy	platform	expressed	Eleving	
Group’s commitment to educating its customers about personal	finance	and	making	informed	financial	decisions. The company aims to educate at least 500,000 consumers in the markets represented by the Group by 2025. 

Arturs Cakars, Group Chief Corporate Affairs Officer:
"Every	financial	services	provider seeks to engage with educated and informed customers who are aware of the fundamentals of financial	management and	can thoughtfully evaluate the opportunities and risks presented by financial products. Educating consumers about money is essential for responsible lending practices and building an economically inclusive society."

## Customer experience 

The Group’s priority is to ensure a transparent and convenient customer journey. Customer satisfaction and operational excellence are essential for Eleving Group to meet its customers’ needs once they choose to buy a new car or apply for a consumer loan.

Eleving Group has developed a customer service division with around 1,200 full-time customer service employees as of 31 December 2023,	delivering	highly	efficient	customer	support	in	local languages across all markets. Eleving Group continuously works to improve customer satisfaction by creating personal contact with its customers through telephone calls, e-mails, and chats, among others, to discuss product options, address customers’ questions, inform customers of their payment due dates, and encourage them to pay on time, discuss late payment arrangements, and help customers with their applications.

In	addition,	the	Group	carefully	monitors	specific	customer service quality ratios, such as call waiting times and abandoned calls. Customer service quality is one of the reasons why customers return to Eleving Group for more services.


## Debt collection

Eleving	Group has established an efficient,	effective,	and	
responsible debt collection process in each country it operates. To ensure consistent quality of debt collection operations across the Group, Eleving Group has developed group-wide debt collection service standards that include 
(i) debt collection principles, (ii) best practices and requirements for the Debt Collection Departments, and (iii) 
internal procedures for each country to ensure practical knowledge sharing and continuous improvement of operations.

Eleving Group’s debt collection team in each country utilizes debt collection measures that comply with local regulations. If the local regulations set standards lower than in other countries where the Group operates, Eleving Group applies the higher standard.

Eleving Group’s strategy is focused on maximizing dialogue with customers. Before the loan becomes overdue, the 
Group has an automated reminder process that ensures that the client is aware of the upcoming payment and payment details.

On	the	first	day	when	the	payment	is	overdue, it	enters	
the early debt collection process, where Eleving Group launches its automated reminder system (auto-calls, texts, e-mails) informing the customer about the overdue amount, further actions if the payment will not be made, and the Group’s contacts to discuss further scenarios. Eleving Group constantly monitors the effectiveness of its automated system. In addition, the Group involves its in-house debt	collection	officers	who	call all	debtors	according	
to a predetermined schedule (as early as Day 1 in some countries) to recover the payable amount, identify the reason for the delay, and, if necessary, offer restructuring possibilities where possible and economically viable. Before pursuing further debt collection activities, Eleving Group first	aims	to	agree	with	a	customer	to	find	a	solution	for	
loan repayment. If an agreement is not reached until Day 
30, the case moves to the next debt collection stage.

When Eleving Group ascertains that a customer can repay their loan, it offers various scenarios and a tailored repayment schedule. If the customer is unable to continue fulfilling	their contractual	obligations,	a	quick	and	efficient	
repossession of the collateral and subsequent sale of it is pursued, maintaining complete transparency with the customer about the process. In the case of unsecured loans, legal collection or debt sale is initiated.

Eleving Group largely handles all debt collection and car repossession activities in-house. The Group has gained substantial expertise in debt collection strategies over the years. In certain countries, Eleving Group outsources parts of the debt collection activities to test and compare the efficiency	of	internal	versus	external	debt	collection.

Eleving Group does not employ controversial debt collection practices, such as using a continuous payment authority or siphoning money from customers’ bank accounts. Such methods are controversial and will or may become illegal in certain jurisdictions. Due to this fact, and from the customer relations and loyalty perspective, Eleving Group firmly	believes	that	its	business	model	is	more	sustainable, organic, and transparent.

Debt collection is improved through regular benchmarking, 
experience sharing, and targeted projects supervised by the 
Group’s operations team to develop best practices across the Group.

## Capital management

The	Group’s	approach to	fundraising	is	twofold. On	the	one	hand,	the	Group	acquires	wholesale	financing	in	the	EUR	currency, evidenced by the bonds issued that serve as a backbone of the funding structure and provide mid- to long-term capital for the Group’s multiple subsidiary businesses. This capital provides the company with the opportunity to execute goals and strategies across all markets.

### Currently listed bonds (31 December 2023)

| Bond Maturity |       EUR                               |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 2024                 | 17,500,000(note 1) (30,000,000) |
| 2026                 | 150,000,000                       |
| 2028                 | 50,000,000                         |
| 2031                 | 25,000,000                         |


On the other hand, the Group utilizes local currency funding, which helps avoid exposure to local currency potentially depreciating against the hard currency and operationally complex hedging solutions. In most cases, 
local currency funding is less expensive than the Group’s funding when including hedging costs and other expenses. To execute local currency funding activities, the approach is multi-faced and depends on the country. The Group has already rolled out the local notes program, which is currently operational in Kenya and Botswana. Eleving Group is working on launching similar programs in a few other countries in 2024. For example, in the Kenya local note program, over EUR 13 mln have been raised for business development and portfolio growth. The local notes program gives	more	flexibility	to	the	investors	and	local	subsidiary.	

Another strategic channel is impact funds. Given the 
Group’s solid footprint in the African region, several impact funds are interested in helping the business to make social impact by funding productive needs of the local community. In many cases, such funding comes with considerably lower funding costs, but at the same time, with strict environmental requirements, such as investments in EV vehicle space, surrounding infrastructure, and climate impact mitigation. This funding avenue aligns with the Group’s long-term sustainability and responsible lending goals. As an example, in 2023, Eleving Group raised USD 7 mln from the Verdant Capital Hybrid Fund for the Kenyan portfolio growth. Verdant Capital Hybrid Fund invests in companies that promote inclusive economic environments in African	countries	and	aims	to	support	financial	institutions that work with SMEs and the self-employed segment, thereby creating new jobs and livelihood opportunities for economically vulnerable groups.

Also, international investment funds are in the Group’s focus, especially those actively investing and having a mandate to invest in emerging economies in Europe, Asia, and Africa.	For	this funding	avenue,	the	main	benefit	is	the	investor’s vast experience, local know-how, and presence on the ground. Given Eleving Group’s expertise in the investment funds channels, the due diligence process in most cases is quicker and more straightforward, and the funders	are	more	flexible to	the	local	business	funding needs and loan issuance peculiarities. In 2023, the foundations were laid for cooperation with ACP Credit, Central	Europe’s	leading	provider	of	financing	solutions	for	middle-market businesses. As a result, in early 2024, Mogo Romania received an investment of EUR 10 mln, making it	the	first	time	in	the	Group’s	history	that	a	significant	external funding partner outside the Mintos marketplace was brought to Mogo Romania.

The	diversification	of	the	funding	structure	and	risks	is	also taking	place	through	bank	financing.	Eleving	Group	is	often chosen as a reliable partner given its history and track record in local economies. The Group typically raises bank funding	in	local	currencies	to	mitigate	FX	risks	and	gain additional	flexibility	in	its	overall	capital	structure.

In addition to these funding sources, the Group works intensively with the largest pan-European lending platform, 
Mintos. This source of capital has a slightly higher cost than bonds, as it is more exposed to the most current market conditions;	however,	it	allows	the	company	the	flexibility	to raise capital as the actual need arises. At the end of 2023, 
Mintos investors had active investments of EUR 63.9 mln in Eleving Group products. Eleving Group has raised more than EUR 1.6 bln in total investments since the launch of 
Mintos through the platform, establishing itself as one of the largest and most successful loan originators on Mintos.

To sum up, the fundraising strategy consists of a balanced approach towards the cost of capital (for the sustainability of the business), funding goals (impact on local communities, mobility improvement), and alignment of financing	segments (responsible lending segments).

## Responsible business conduct

Eleving Group strives for transparency, trust, and integrity. This approach applies to all its business entities and markets and the Group’s clients and business relations.

The Group is committed to initiating and maintaining collaboration across the financial industry and continuously investing in the supplier selection process to promote sustainability and ethical behavior in the business environment.

## Anti-fraud and anti-corruption policy

Eleving Group has developed and adopted its Anti-corrup -tion, Anti-bribery, and Anti-fraud Policy, which aims to en -sure a common understanding of the problems arising from corruption and fraud, its types, responsibilities, and action models to prevent corrupt and fraudulent activities within 
Eleving Group, and in relations with external partners and those involved in the political process. This policy applies and is binding to all Eleving Group employees and em -ployees of Eleving Group’s subsidiaries, regardless of their position. Eleving Group is committed to complying with all applicable anti-bribery and corruption laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Eleving Group has zero tolerance against bribery, corruption, and other activi -ties that are unethical, unacceptable, and inconsistent with the Group’s values. Eleving Group strives to operate with transparency, trust, and integrity. This approach applies to all of its markets of operation and all business relations.

The	policy	defines	corruption	as	dishonest	behavior	and	
criminal action by those in positions of power, such as com -pany	representatives	or	government	officials.	Corruption	
can include giving or accepting bribes or inappropriate gifts, 
double-dealing, under-the-table transactions, manipulating elections, diverting funds, laundering money, and defraud -ing investors. In comparison, bribery is the act of promis -ing, giving, receiving, or agreeing to receive money or some other item	of	value	with	the	corrupt	aim	of	influencing	a public official or business partner	to	discharge	their	official	
duties. Fraud is the crime of using dishonest methods to take something valuable from another person or company 
(money, property, information, technology, product, trust, etc.).

The policy guides those working for Eleving Group; every employee must follow its principles. The sole purpose of the policy is to set out the responsibilities of Eleving Group and its personnel regarding our zero-tolerance against bribery and corruption. The core principles are as follows:   

 Company representatives shall not offer, promise, 
give, request, accept, or receive bribes or another undue advantage to facilitate Eleving Group’s business. Promising,	offering,	or	providing	any	benefit	to	a	person	
who exercises public authority is strictly prohibited.

 Company representatives are prohibited from offering, 
giving, and accepting gifts, events, trips, and other traveling arrangements unless such activities comply with the allowed limits, are open, moderate, match clear business objectives, and are commensurate with business relations. Activities to strengthen and establish client and supplier relations shall be made in good faith and compliance with the requirements set by Eleving Group.

 Eleving Group’s good practice stipulates that an employee must not individually decide whether to accept gifts whose purpose may be questionable, as well as gifts exceeding the value of EUR 150.00. Gifts whose value exceeds the aforementioned threshold must be immediately reported.

 It is prohibited to accept money as a gift under any circumstances.

 Eleving Group supports contributions to the communities where it does business and permits reasonable donations to charities and sponsorships. Sponsoring and donations shall be made in an open and transparent manner.

 Eleving Group never donates to political parties, 
politicians, or political campaigns. Eleving Group is politically neutral.

 It is forbidden for company representatives to ask for or accept a donation from a private person or legal entity and	other	types	of	financial	assistance	if	the	donation	
or assistance affects the decision-making regarding this person.

44


#### pg:44

  The good practice of Eleving Group determines that no favoritism is allowed in the selection of partners for the provision of services. In every procurement procedure or selection of service providers, at least three applicants (unless it is impossible to obtain three offers due to objective circumstances) must be evaluated, choosing the partner or supplier that can provide the highest price-performance level.

 In situations where the partner’s representative is personally known	outside	of	the	professional field, is	a	relative,	or a spouse, the final decision	is taken collectively or by a decision of competent and neutral managers.

 Favoritism is also not allowed in the selection of employees; a human resource manager cannot make an individual decision to hire a friend, family member, or partner.

 Employees do not engage in private activities and refrain from side jobs and combining positions that may interfere with the responsibilities and professional performance and create suspicions of potential, apparent,	or	actual	conflict	of	interest.  

All Eleving Group employees are informed about the adopted policy, its content, and its importance in ensuring the transparency of Eleving Group’s business processes. Employees are immediately notified of amendments	to	the	policy. Department heads update their subordinates on the current policy once a year, while new employees are informed	and	instructed	about	the	policy	in	the	first	week	
of work. Around 95% of employees dealing with clients and suppliers have received training on anti-corruption.

Employees undergo internal training once a year, examining the	concepts	defined	in	the	policy	and	their	manifestations in various situations. During the training, employees understand how to act in situations characterized by an ethical dilemma and in situations where a potential case of	corruption,	bribery,	conflict	of	interest,	or	fraud	exists.	Employees are informed about the procedure for reporting such situations.


## Anti-money laundering, countering terrorism	and	proliferation financing, sanctions compliance


Eleving Group strives to stay one step ahead of criminals who seek	to	use	the	global	financial	system	for	money laundering. We recognize the challenges and dangers posed by this criminal activity. Therefore, Eleving Group has approved and regularly updates its Anti-Money Laundering, 
Countering Terrorism Financing, and Proliferation Financing 
(AML/ CTF/PF) Policy, which formulates Eleving Group’s general principles and methods to determine measures for the assessment and management of money laundering, 
terrorism,	and	proliferation	financing	and	international	
sanctions risks inherent in Eleving Group. Furthermore, 
Eleving Group has put in place appropriate processes to mitigate those risks and to protect Eleving Group’s customers and employees from the money laundering, terrorism,	and	proliferation	financing	and	international sanctions violation risks. The Group also pays close attention to breaches of sanctions or other illegal activities. Eleving Group and its subsidiaries do not deal with sanctioned companies or individuals. Compliance with this standard is strictly monitored.

Given that Eleving Group entities are located in multiple jurisdictions, their policies and procedures are tweaked to the various jurisdictions Eleving Group’s subsidiaries operate	in	and	consider not	only the specific local legal requirements but also product nuances, Eleving Group’s AML/CTF/PF best practices, and international recommendations and guidelines, thus ensuring the highest level of AML/CTF/PF and global sanctions compliance reasonably possible.

The country managers in each jurisdiction are responsible for preventing money laundering and ensuring compliance.

Besides, at each of the Group’s companies, there is an 

(45)

#### pg:45 (make sure that the text flow between pages continues without 45 in the middle)


AML team of several AML specialists. The team works closely with various internal departments and committees, including the legal department and client support, to achieve AML-related goals and adhere to international and local legal requirements.

Along with the internal know-your-client (KYC) investigative practices, Eleving Group uses a special information technology solution that enhances compliance and provides	faster	and	more	efficient	AML	checks.	This allows performing the required client due diligence and 
KYC checks, monitoring and screening transactions, 
and reporting suspicious transactions or sanctions infringements. It enables the effective evaluation of the potential risks associated with each client and ensures that the Group adheres to the Group’s policies and standards.

To ensure full compliance with the AML legal requirements, 
the internal AML practices are reviewed and amended at least once every 18 months according to globally consistent policies, standards, and local legal requirements. Furthermore, internal and external AML and sanctions compliance audits are performed regularly, and in case any	findings	and	recommendations	are	received,	those	are implemented in due course to ensure maximum compliance with the applicable legal regulations.


## Insider trading

Eleving Group`s Policy on Preventing Insider Trading and the laws of the countries in which it operates prohibit trading in securities (in our case, debt securities or bonds) while possessing material non-public information regarding the issuer.

According to this policy, all the Group’s employees must not engage or attempt to engage in insider trading or circumvent that obligation by any means, which includes:

 Improperly disclosing inside information or recommending the third party to trade or cancel or amend an order while in possession of inside information (tipping off); or  

  using such a recommendation as referred to above where the employee knows or ought to know it is based on inside information.

Furthermore, the Group’s general principle reiterates that in case of any doubt, employees should treat non-public information as inside information and consult with management before engaging in any transaction. This approach effectively ensures that employees do not enter into transactions that amount to or create the appearance of market manipulation.

To enhance compliance with insider trading prevention policies, the Group uses information technology services that maintain an up-to-date list of persons who have access to insider (price-sensitive) information and regularly inform these persons about their duties and obligations under the Group’s Policy on Preventing Insider Trading.

In addition to the above, all the Group’s employees must adhere	to	specific	information	barriers	to	protect	insider	
(price-sensitive) information. This includes:

 Prevent	confidential	information	from	being	shared	with individuals not authorized to know such information.

 Restricting access to potentially material non-public information to those persons who do not necessarily need to see it to perform their work duties.

 Addressing	actual	or	potential	conflicts	of	interest	
related to business activities.

Failure to comply with this policy may lead to sanctions imposed by the Group, including dismissal for cause, whether or not the failure to abide by this policy results in an actual violation of the law.

## Whistleblowing

Eleving Group is committed to the highest levels of ethics and integrity in its business. The Group values integrity, compliance, and ethics and believes that the way to build a culture of trust is to learn to speak up when something is not right so that the Group can address the problem. Eleving Group understands that this is crucial to its continued success and reputation. Therefore, Eleving Group has devised its Whistleblowing Policy and reporting system called Trust Line, available at https://bit.ly/3aOqfYM.

TrustLine is an anonymous form to report concerns about misconduct, improper and/or illegal activity within or in relation to Eleving Group. This solution allows sharing concerns regarding violations of the Group’s policies, local laws, regulations, fraud, and corruption without fear of negative consequences or retributions. Eleving Group ensures that	the	reporting	on	actual	and	potential	conflicts of	interest	is	confidential,	and	the	reporting	employees,	
clients, and suppliers are protected from discrimination and retaliation.

The Whistleblowing Policy aims to provide clarity on how 
Eleving Group will support whistleblowers so that they:

 Are encouraged to express their concerns.

 Know how to report their concerns.

 Know their rights, including their right to remain anonymous.

 Know what will happen if they report their concerns.

 Feel safe in reporting their concerns.

 Will not be subject to retaliation, detriment, or victimization in response to reporting their concerns.  

Anyone with evidence or reasonable suspicion that one of Eleving Group’s employees or business partners has violated the established norms or that Eleving Group commits systematic procedural violations can report it through the whistleblowing system. A competent Whistleblower Report coordinator monitors the Trust Line 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The Trust Line allows reporting anonymously.

The Group’s management structure is designed to ensure effective team management and transparency. It is designed to encourage team members to have mutual trust and respect and to be able to report any misconduct. Direct relationships among employees and all levels of the management team are facilitated so everyone would feel comfortable communicating and escalating any issues through multiple avenues. Eleving Group believes employees should feel safe and assured that their rights are observed and applicable laws are strictly followed. In the event of inappropriate treatment, employees always have the right and possibility to submit a complaint or suggestion to the respective manager or HR department.

In 2023, 14 reports of misconduct were received, recording a decrease of 44% (25 reports in 2022) compared to a year ago. Out of 14 reports, 11 were related to the Group’s vehicle	financing	companies;	moreover,	five	were	submitted	
by clients, while 6 were submitted internally by employees.
For the consumer segment, only 3 reports were recorded, 
and two out of them were from clients, while an employee submitted one. The highest number of reports was related to Kenya (7); two were recorded in Georgia and North 
Macedonia, while Uzbekistan, Moldova, and Albania had one misconduct report. All whistleblowing reports were resolved.

## Data privacy 

Eleving Group protects its customers, employees, and partners` privacy and ensures compliance with the applicable data protection laws and regulations. As business entities of Eleving Group enter new markets and its customer base grows, the work on data privacy is ongoing. Globally, over 320 000 active customers, 2760 employees, and over 2200 partners have entrusted Eleving Group with their personal data.

The Group aims to ensure that this information is processed securely and follows applicable laws and regulations. To achieve this, goals and internal requirements are set and followed when dealing with personal data.


### Eleving Group’s data processing principles

 Process data only for the purposes it was collected

 Provide honest and transparent information to the individual

 Do not retain data, if it is no longer needed

 Ensure legal basis to process personal data

 Use only accurate and precise data

 Respect the individual’s rights to privacy

 Use minimum amount of data necessary

 Monitor and ensure compliance with local privacy laws

 Ensure data security, integrity and confidentiality at every step



As Eleving Group operates in different markets and jurisdictions, it is subject not only to the General Data 
Protection Regulation No. 679/2016 of the European 
Parliament and of the Council (GDPR) but also to different national requirements for personal data protection. At entities in the European Union, the Group has carried out multiple privacy-related external audits, reviewed its procedures, and adopted documentation to address GDPR requirements and improve data protection standards. All Eleving Group business entities have adopted the same general privacy framework, complemented by additional local requirements. Eleving Group strives to achieve a unified	approach	across	the	Group	and	provide	a	high level of technical and organizational security measures.

The Group continuously reviews existing procedures and educates its employees on applicable laws and regulations concerning privacy, data protection, and other relevant matters such as information security. Personal data protection and information security training is organized regularly at a Group and local level to educate employees and raise awareness on the subject. In addition, starting from the end of 2020, the Group uses the OneTrust system to operationalize and manage privacy-related requirements, assess and monitor compliance, and ensure a common approach to different data protection aspects and compliance requirements.

 Security measures’ common approach

 General privacy framework

 Improvement audits

 Staff education & training

 Privacy management system “OneTrust"


Privacy and data protection projects are coordinated throughout the Group by the Group’s general data protection counsel, with the assistance of local data protection	officers, legal,	risk,	business	development, and IT teams. Such a governance model ensures overreaching support and a common approach to the Group’s privacy objectives and standards and addresses the local legal requirements.

Eleving Group’s employees are bound by strict confidentiality requirements	and	must	not	intentionally	or	accidentally disclose sensitive information while performing their work duties. The information is protected, regardless of whether it belongs to Eleving Group or its stakeholders.

Employees are precluded	from	using	confidential information obtained during their employment in Eleving Group for personal gain or the advancement of private interests.

## Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity is of paramount importance to Eleving Group for several intertwined reasons. The	Group	handles	highly	sensitive	financial data, including bank account details and personal	identification	information, necessitating	
stringent protection to maintain customer trust and comply with the regulatory standards like GDPR, NIS2, DORA, and others. Moreover, preventing	fraud	is	critical,	as	fintech	entities are the prime targets for cybercriminals seeking to exploit vulnerabilities for illicit gains. Robust cybersecurity measures safeguard against unauthorized access and fraudulent transactions and ensure business continuity by mitigating the risks of cyberattacks such as ransomware or DDoS attacks. Also, fostering trust and preserving	reputation	is	imperative	in	the	fintech	industry, where any security breach could lead to customer churn and reputational damage. Finally, safeguarding intellectual property against theft or unauthorized access further underscores the importance of robust cybersecurity measures in sustaining the competitive edge and long-term success	of	fintech	enterprises.

In 2023, Eleving Group enhanced employee awareness training to cover and explain the basic social engineering attack vectors and expected user	behavior.	If	a	specific	case	is	spotted,	the	responsible employee for cybersecurity carries out multichannel and multiformat communication and educates employees on the nature of the attack, goals of the attackers, and related risks. Also, in late 2023, the Information security team initiated a phishing simulation test involving the Eleving Group employees in all countries and subsidiaries. These activities are aimed to
be continued every year. On top of that, the Group has implemented advanced security monitoring and SIEM solutions. They are continuously improved for the company to be able to respond promptly when an incident happens. The Group is continuously improving and implementing new sensors for infrastructure and network safety.

In 2023, 48 external incidents were reported, and 
75% were related to phishing and similar social engineering. Around 20% of the incidents were related to low staff awareness of cyber security and digital hygiene. Less than 5% of the incidents were related to attacks on the Group’s websites. All incidents were resolved promptly.


## Sustainable supply chain

A sustainable supply chain is essential to minimize the risks	for	the	Group,	influence	the	industry,	and	drive real and meaningful global change.

Eleving Group’s business depends on certain services provided by third parties, such as banks, local consumer credit agencies, IT service providers, and debt-collection agencies. An inability to maintain existing business relationships with banks, local consumer credit agencies, 
IT service providers, debt-collection agencies, and other third-party providers or the failure by these third-party providers to maintain the quality of their services or otherwise provide their services to the Group may have a material	adverse	effect	on	the	Group’s	business, financial condition,	operating results, prospects,	or	cash flows.

To minimize the Group’s external costs and risks when new business relationships are established with a new or existing supplier, Eleving Group has drawn up its internal procurement guidelines in line with the Group’s strategic direction and internal and external regulations. Employees must screen suppliers against the economic sanctions list, perform sanity checks (tax debts, overall reputation), and conduct general research on whether the suppliers have adopted their code of conduct and follow good corporate practices. Most supplier agreements are entered into for a period shorter than one year, and before the extension of an agreement, the said procedures are repeated. Since Eleving Group needs to choose suppliers with similar values and responsible business conduct, the Group plans to invest in improving the supplier selection process. The goal by 2025 is to assess all key suppliers according to the Group’s ESG criteria. Currently, the Group mainly outsources certain IT services, such as software development, data center, and technical support.

## Human rights statement 

Human rights are fundamental rights belonging to every person in the world. They form the foundation for freedom, 
justice, and peace. They apply equally and universally in all countries, irrespective of the legal framework.

Eleving Group respects universal human rights in all markets where it operates. The Group follows the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the UN Global Compact, which form the basis for its efforts to respect human rights. The Group complies with all relevant international legal obligations and local legal obligations in the countries and regions in which it operates.

Eleving Group respects employee human rights as established in the International Labour Organisation’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, including non-discrimination, prohibition of child and forced labor, and safe and healthy working conditions. The Group offers equal opportunities and rights to all, regardless of sex, national or ethnic origin, religion or belief, age, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or disability.

Eleving	Group	firmly	stands	against	human	rights	violations,	including child and forced labor. The Group does not employ children and strongly believes any employee should be able to freely negotiate and accept terms and conditions of employment relations and should not be coerced or forced to accept unfair or discriminatory terms. The Group applies the same principles within its supply chain and does not cooperate or engage with suppliers or service providers who do not adhere to them.

## General principles of communication, sponsorship, and advertising  

Eleving Group implements its communication activities in compliance with the principles of responsible communication and locally adopted laws and regulations.

The Group strongly opposes communication that misleads customers and the public in any way. Eleving Group does not sponsor events, people, or organizations whose reputation, products, or event concepts call into question honesty, ethics, or other generally accepted values.


## Investor relations 

Eleving Group is committed to protecting the interests of all shareholders and investors and thus makes sure it complies with all relevant laws and regulations. Eleving Group aims to generate returns to shareholders on a sustainable long-term basis by continuously improving its services, products, 
and	business	processes	with	a	focus	on	profitability	and	 cost efficiency.

The Group is committed to maintaining transparent business processes in which investors can understand 
Eleving Group’s planned short-term, medium-term, and long-term development projects and investments and the	actual	financial	and	nonfinancial	results. Considering the international scale of Eleving Group’s business and sustainable business principles, it is essential for Eleving 
Group to cooperate with investors who are not exposed to various sanctions risks. Eleving Group distances itself from investors about whom doubts may arise or whose origin of funds	cannot	be	verified.

In early 2023, the Group won the Best Investor Relations on the First North Bond List category of the Nasdaq Baltic Awards. The award is presented every second year as part of the Nasdaq Baltic Awards ceremony, which celebrates outstanding achievements by Nasdaq Baltic-listed companies in the areas of transparency, sound corporate governance, and investor relations.

## Powers of the shareholder 

The shareholders’ general meeting exercises power granted by the Luxembourg Company Law, including (i) appointing and removing the directors (the “Directors”) and the statutory or independent auditor of the Group as well as setting their remuneration, (ii) approving the annual	financial	statements of the	Group,	(iii) amending the articles of association of the Group, (iv) deciding on the dissolution and liquidation of the Group, (v) changing the nationality of the Group, and (vi) rights to amend the financial	statements	after	their	issue.


## General powers of the directors/the board  

The Group is currently managed by a board of directors (the “Board”) whose members have been appointed as type A 
Directors and type B Directors by the shareholders’ general meeting of the Group. In accordance with the Luxembourg 
Company Law, each type A Director and type B Director may be removed at any time without cause (révocation ad nutum).

Meetings of the Board are convened upon request of the chairman of the Board or any two Directors of the Group as often as the interest of the Group so requires. The meetings of the Board are validly held if, at the commencement of the meeting, at least one type A Director and one type B Director is present or represented, and decisions are validly taken by the majority of the Directors present or represented (including at least one type A Director and at least one type B Director). Any Director may represent one or more other Directors at a Board`s meeting. The Board of the Group may, from time to time, delegate its power to conduct the daily management (gestion journalière) of the Group to one or more Directors, i.e., the managing director(s) (administrateur(s) délégué(s)), commit the management of the affairs of the Group to one or more Directors or give special powers for determined matters to one or more proxy holders.

Pursuant to its articles of association, where the Group is administrated by the Board comprising several categories of Directors, it shall be bound by the joint signatures of a type A Director and a type B Director. Thus, the “four eyes” 
principle is established.

The Group is currently managed by a Board composed of two Directors of type A and two Directors of type B, elected pursuant to resolutions of the shareholders of the Group. Based on the articles of association of the Group, Directors of each category are vested with the same individual powers and duties. The Directors of type B are Luxembourg residents, whereas the Directors of type A are not Luxembourg residents and, at the same time, hold the positions of CEO and CFO within the Group. The board of directors has not appointed a chairperson among its members so far.

## Audit Committee 

In 2019, the Group established an audit committee. The audit committee	oversees	the	Group’s	financial	reporting	
process to ensure transparency and integrity of the published financial	information, the	effectiveness	of	the	Group’s internal control and risk management system, the effectiveness of the internal audit function, the effectiveness of the independent audit process of the Group, including recommending the appointment and assessing the performance of the external auditor, and the effectiveness of the process for monitoring compliance with laws and regulations	affecting	financial	reporting	and	the	code	of business conduct (where applicable).

The audit committee is set up, and its members are appointed by Eleving Group’s Board of Directors. The audit	committee	is	comprised	of	three	members:	Mārtiņš	Muižnieks,	Bertrand	de	Fays,	and	Franck-Oliviera	Cera, each of them appointed for a period of three years. The audit committee reports directly to the Company’s Board of Directors.

## Risks and risk management 

Risk management	at	Eleving	Group	is	defined	as	a	process	of identifying, monitoring, and managing potential risks to mitigate the negative impact they may have on the Group. To	ensure	efficient	significant	risk	management	at all stages, Eleving Group describes the general framework and duties in its internal policies and guidelines.

Internal policies and guidelines set out the following objectives for each of the Group’s operating companies:

 To establish the framework required for the identification	of	significant	risks.			
  To	assess	exposure	to	significant	risks.			
  To establish the techniques and indicators to be used for	the	management	of	significant	risks,	including	with	
reference to the adequacy of the limits system.

 To allocate the risk management duties within the entity.
 To establish the framework required for risk reporting 
(reporting typology—indicators, content, frequency, users).

 To	establish	the	entity’s	risk	profile	in	line	with	the	
entity’s business strategy.

 To establish the measures required for addressing the conflicts	of	interests	at	the	level	of	the	risk	management function and the conditions required for the independent exercise of the risk management function.

The risk management process at Eleving Group consists of four main parts:

 Risk identification.	
 Risk management.
 Risk monitoring.
 Risk control.

Eleving	Group	has	defined	the	following	significant	risks: (i) financial risk,	(ii) legal	risk, (iii)	operational	risk,	(iv) reputational risk, and (v) ESG risk.

The Group’s activities are exposed to a variety of risks:

 Liquidity risk.
 Credit risk.
 Market risk (including currency risk and interest rate risk).

The	Group’s	overall	risk	management	focuses	on	financial
markets and seeks to minimize potential adverse effects on	the	Group’s	financial	performance. The Group	uses derivative	financial	instruments	to	hedge	specific	risk	
exposures carried out by the central treasury department 
(the Group’s treasury).

The Group controls its liquidity by managing the amount of funding it attracts through peer-to-peer marketplace platforms for loans, which provides the management with	greater	flexibility	to	manage	the	level	of	borrowings and available cash balances. Also, the Group manages its longer-term liquidity needs by obtaining funding from international capital markets, in particular by issuing the Bonds.

The	Group	is	exposed	to	credit	risk	through	its	finance	lease receivables, loans, and advances, as well as cash and cash equivalents. The key areas of credit risk policy cover the lease and loan granting process (including the solvency check of the lessee or the borrower), monitoring methods, and	decision-making	principles.	The	Group	uses	financed	
vehicles	as	collateral	to	reduce	the	credit	risk significantly. The	Group	operates	by	applying	a	clear	set	of	finance	lease and loan granting criteria. These criteria include assessing the customer’s credit history, lease and loan repayment means, and understanding the lease object. The Group considers both quantitative and qualitative factors when assessing the customer’s creditworthiness. Based on this analysis, the Group sets the credit limit for each customer. When the lease agreement has been signed, the Group monitors the lease object and the customer’s solvency. The Group has developed a lease monitoring process that helps quickly spot any possible non-compliance with the provisions of the agreement. The receivable balances are monitored continuously to ensure that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is minimized and, where appropriate, 
sufficient	provisions	are	made.The Group does not	have a	 significant credit	risk exposure to any single	counterparty but is exposed to risks to counterparties with similar characteristics.

The Group takes on exposure to market risks, which are the risks	that	the	fair	value	or	future	cash	flows	of	a financial	instrument	will	fluctuate	because	of	changes	in	market	prices. Market risks arise from open positions in the interest rate and currency products, all of which are exposed to general	and	specific	market	movements	and	changes	in	the	level of volatility or market rates or prices, such as interest rates and foreign exchange rates.

Currency	risk	is	defined	as	the	risk	that	the	value	of a financial	instrument	will	fluctuate	due	to	changes	in foreign exchange rates. The Group is exposed to the effects of fluctuations	in	the	prevailing	foreign	currency	exchange rates	on	its	financial	position	and	cash	flows.	The	most
significant	foreign	currency	exposure	comes	from	Georgia, Armenia, Uzbekistan, Kenya, Uganda, and Moldova. In most of the markets, except for Kenya and Uganda, the 
Group has evaluated potential hedging options but, due to the costs associated with it, has decided not to pursue a hedging strategy for now and assume potential short to	mid-term	currency	fluctuations	with	retaining	potential upside from strengthening of the mentioned currencies. Nevertheless, from a foreign currency perspective, the 
Group practices pricing in the currency risk within the cost of its products in the most volatile markets.

In addition, the Group is making substantial progress in issuing as many loans as possible in EUR and USD 
currencies.	Having	now	a	significant	portfolio	of	USD	loans and leases, mainly linked to Belarus, Kenya, and Uganda, 
the Group has started to manage the foreign currency exposure risk towards USD proactively. The proactive management of USD exposure can be observed by forward contract purchases that began in 2020 and have continued since then.

Cash	flow	interest	rate	risk	means	the	risk	that	future	cash flows	of	a	financial	instrument	will	fluctuate due	to	changes in market interest rates. Fair value interest rate risk is the risk	that	the	value	of	a	financial	instrument	will	fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates, in particular, that the	Group’s	income	or	the	value	of its	portfolios	of	financial assets might be affected as a result. The management of Eleving Group believes that for the Group, interest rate risk is not material since the vast majority of loans are issued and	received at	fixed	rates,	and	most	of	the	borrowings	and	loans issued to customers are long-term.

55

#### pg:55 

Legal risks are mainly derived from regulatory changes, 
which the Group successfully manages with the help of an in-house legal department and external legal advisors that closely follow the latest developments and the legal environment. While most of Eleving Group’s operating entities are	financial	institutions,	the	Group	is	not	regulated	
as a bank, payment institution, or e-money institution in any of its operating jurisdictions. The regulatory framework applicable to the Group’s operating entities varies depending on the jurisdiction in which they operate. The relevant regulations relate to, inter alia, lending and leasing activities, consumer rights protection, the processing of personal data, debt collection, and the prevention of money laundering	and	financing	of	terrorism.

The Group’s operational risks are managed by rigid underwriting procedures in the loan issuance process and efficient debt	collection	procedures.

Reputational risk is concerned with the exposure of Eleving 
Group to events that could adversely affect customers’ 
trust in its products, could decrease its customer portfolio, 
or	could	lead	to:	(i)	an	increased	difficulty	in	attracting	
new	customers;	(ii) difficulty	raising	finance; (iii)	difficulty	
in retaining employees; (iv) non-compliance with the requirements set forth by local authorities. The Group’s reputational risk monitoring is performed, e.g., by monitoring the local and central media, monitoring Eleving Group’s activity with the focus on the events that could expose	the	Group	to	a	reputational risk (specifically	those	related to customer relations and the relationships with the supervisory authority), and monitoring the number of complaints received from customers.

Scientific	evidence (note1) suggests that climate change and the associated need to transition towards an environmentally sustainable economy will lead to changes in the real economy that will,	in	turn,	impact	the	financial	sector through new risks and opportunities. Eleving Group has become aware of the importance of ESG risks in recent years. It has begun to work purposefully to manage them by developing its Strategic ESG Program 2022–2025 and initiating sustainability reporting. For Eleving Group, ESG risks include the following:

 Climate change—changes in the policy and regulatory context; timely development of innovative products and services, supporting the reduction of CO2 emissions and customer preferences; business interruption due to chronic (e.g., temperature increase, etc.) or extreme 
(e.g.,	floods,	etc.)	events	on	key	company	assets,	i.e.,	
physical risk.

 Responsible use of natural resources—optimization of material cycles, in terms of recycling, waste, etc., 
management; sustainable resource (water, electricity, etc.) management.

 Human resources management—diversity, equal opportunities; health, safety, and well-being of employees; attraction, retention, and development of talent; employee training and development.

 Responsible lending—compliance with legal and voluntary regulations.

 Customers—customer relations (e.g., conduct, non discrimination, mislabeling products); customer data protection; evolving customer preferences regarding sustainable products; increasing use of digitalization and automation;	affordable/accessible	financial products.

  Impact on local communities—providing access to finance	for	diverse	groups.

 Business ethics and integrity—prevention, detection, 
and countering unlawful behavior by employees, clients, 
and/or suppliers (incl. corruption, AML) and compliance with related international and national legislation.

## Main features of internal control and risk management systems in relation to	the	process	of	consolidated financial statements


The employees involved in the accounting process meet qualitative standards and receive regular training. Duties and responsibilities are clearly assigned to different roles. Complex evaluations are assigned	to	specialized	service	providers who involve qualified in-house staff. Separating administrative, executive, settlement, and report preparation functions reduces the possibility of fraud. Internal processes also ensure that changes in the Group’s economic or legal environment are mapped and that new or amended legal provisions are applied in the Group’s accounting.

The	Group’s	accounting	rules also govern specific formal requirements	 placed	on	consolidated financial statements. These include the mandatory use of a standardized and complete reporting package. The Group’s Accounting Department assists the Regional units in resolving complex accounting issues. Additional data for the presentation of external information in the notes and the Group’s management report is also prepared and aggregated at the Group level. Reporting packages containing errors are identified	and	corrected	at	the	Regional or	Group	level. Impairment tests	are	conducted	centrally	 for	the	specific cash-generating units, known as CGUs, from the Group’s perspective to ensure that consistent, standardized evaluation criteria are applied.

## Business highlights

### An outstanding year with promising prospects for robust growth in the future 


** Operational and Strategic Highlights**  

  Eleving Group closed 2023 with the best-ever business performance. Revenues, including fee and commission income, for the corresponding period reached EUR 189.3 
mln, recording an increase of EUR 13.7 mln, compared to 2022. Meanwhile, the net portfolio grew by EUR 27.3 
mln and landed at EUR 320.3 mln.

 Diversified business operations and a	balanced revenue stream from all core business lines:

- Flexible lease and subscription-based products contributed EUR 50.4 mln to the 2023 revenues—a decrease of 2%, mainly due to the sale of the Renti Plus portfolio and the slightly decreasing Kenya motorcycle taxi loan portfolio (effect from unfavorable foreign currency rate development).

- Traditional lease and leaseback products contributed 
EUR 66.2 mln to the revenue stream, up by 7% compared to the respective period a year ago. The recorded increase can be explained by a steady and controlled portfolio and interest income growth across most of the Group’s markets, with the highest growth rates recorded in Romania, Lithuania, and Moldova.

- Revenues from the consumer loan segment contributed EUR 72.7 mln to the 2023 revenues—a significant	leap	of	over 20%. The	strong	results	were driven	by	the	efficient integration	of	the	Sub-Saharan	consumer	financing business	and	outstanding	performance in the Group’s European consumer markets.

 In early Q3, Eleving Group integrated the ExpressCredit consumer	financing	business	in	four	Sub-Saharan	region countries. As a result, Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, and 
Lesotho joined the Group’s portfolio.

 In July, Renti Plus business operations in Latvia were sold to Transporent Ltd, a Latvian subsidiary of the international mobility	services	provider SIXT. The respective transaction included the sale of more than 100 vehicles from the Renti Plus fleet and its active customer portfolio.

 In Q4, the Group issued EUR 50 mln of senior secured and guaranteed Eleving Group 2023/2028 bonds. As a result, over 2,000 new investors from the Baltic states and Europe were onboarded, and the debt maturity profile	was	significantly	improved. Shortly after, Fitch Ratings assigned a rating of ‘B-‘ with a Recovery Rating of ‘RR4’ to the respective bonds.

 In mid-Q4, the Group launched a new initiative in 
Kenya— retrofitting	internal combustion	engine motorcycles to electric. The main objective of this product is to intensify the introduction of sustainable mobility in Kenya and to give a second life to used motorcycles, thereby extending their life cycle. By the end	of	the	year, Mogo Kenya had already retrofitted several motorcycles, and a healthy spike in demand is expected in 2024.

 As part of its foreign currency exchange risk management strategy during Q4, the Group established cooperation with MFX Currency Risk Solutions (USA)	and	Absa Bank (Uganda). As a result, in January 2024, the Group companies entered in currency hedging contracts to fully cover the Group’s exposure with respect to the Ugandan shilling.

 In the sustainable mobility area, Eleving Group continued to roll out its electric car-sharing service in	Latvia	and	electric motorcycle	financing	in	Kenya. In 2023, over 3.2 mln kilometers were commuted on pure electricity by the Group’s clients. Therefore, both green mobility services have reduced the potential CO2 emissions by approximately 300 to 315t, compared to the amount an internal combustion engine would have generated.

 An important milestone in digitization was reached by launching an advanced online client cabinet for the Romanian market. The project will ensure active onboarding of existing clients and 24/7 account access; it will provide real-time information on agreements, customer information, payment history, and plans. On top of that, it provides numerous payment methods that focus on promoting recurring (subscription) payments. It is planned to implement the respective project gradually across other Group markets.

 In January 2024, the Group received all the necessary approvals from Belarussian government authorities with respect to the Mogo Belarus sale. The sale is expected to be finished within	2024 once all aspects	of	the	transaction,	including asset	refinance,	will be	implemented. For reporting purposes, Mogo Belarus is classified	as	a	discontinued	operation	(also in comparatives).

## Comments from Eleving Group CEO and CFO 
 
### Eleving Group CEO Modestas Sudnius  

Entering this year, it was clear that high inflation rates	and	
the growing cost of borrowing would challenge overall client payment	behavior.	Also,	Eleving	Group	had	a	significant	
debt of its own, which had to be managed in the best possible way.	And	finally, we	had	a	goal	to	increase	our	 efficiency	and	profitability	as	an	organization	further.

In retrospect, I can tell that we had set highly ambitious goals, and I am delighted that we managed to achieve most of them and beyond. We have had a stable year with increasing portfolio quality. In the second part of the year, we laid the foundation for further growth in 2024 through the	integration	of	consumer finance	businesses	in	the	South African region, seizing new opportunities in our existing markets,	and	securing future	financing	by	issuing	EUR	50 mln worth of new bonds.

Despite the prevailing uncertainty in the global economy, 
the demand for consumer credit products did not weaken, 
and the people’s ability to pay was still higher than expected	despite	the	surging	interest rates and	inflation.	

In	the	vehicle	financing	segment,	after	a	slightly	slower start, we gathered momentum in the second half of the year. This was anticipated as people temporarily postponed large purchases. In the meantime, the unsecured consumer finance	business	grew	steadily	throughout	the	year,	
benefiting	from	the	weakening	competition	and	utilizing	
previously established business essentials—a vast sales network	through	online	and	offline	channels	and	well-calibrated customer scoring models.

We	have	successfully	addressed	the	diversification	of	
our funding structure by unlocking numerous additional financing	channels	like	local	impact	funds,	bank	loans,	local notes, and, of course, the latest bond issue that attracted EUR 50 mln and improved our debt maturity	profile. Also, we continue to maintain lean operations and strong cost discipline. Together with the increasing digitization of our daily processes, we have managed to maintain a very cost-effective	business despite the inflationary environment.

In recent years, we have primarily focused on organic expansion in our core business lines. Yet, the integration of the ExpressCredit business will allow us to expand while still maintaining a strong position in our existing markets. We are open to exploring further growth opportunities through new market launches or acquisitions. However, it will	not	happen	at	the	expense	of	the	profit,	and	this would become a priority in case of additional equity injection in the business. We will continue to actively participate in the capital markets and explore all the opportunities they offer.	Having	a	well-diversified	debt	stack	in	place	with	no	significant	maturities	upcoming	in	2024,	our	focus	will	be	on	
potential equity raising, exploring opportunities both in the 
Baltic markets and outside, not ruling out an IPO.

In the meantime, the Group strengthened its position in green mobility by rapidly expanding its electric car- sharing service	in	Latvia	and	the	electric	motorcycle	financing service in Kenya. The Group’s customers covered over 3.2 mln kilometers, using electricity-powered vehicles, thus reducing over 300tCO2 compared to what traditional vehicles would have produced. In 2023, more profoundly than before, we saw that people paid much more attention to the so-called value-for-money criteria. This translated into more sustainable decisions, i.e., a greater demand for green mobility solutions that are more climate-friendly and economical in the medium- to long- term. This trend is likely to continue next year, so we expect good results from our sustainable mobility products.

## Eleving Group CFO Māris Kreics

Despite the challenging year of peak interest rates and inflation,	Eleving	Group	achieved	strong	results	in	all	key	
financial	indicators.	The	Group’s	adjusted EBITDA increased to EUR 77.5 mln, or by over 18%, compared to 2022, while the total revenue, including fee and commission income, reached EUR 189.3 mln, showing an increase of close to 8%. The adjusted net profit before FX landed at EUR 29.5 mln, up by 29%, while the net portfolio reached EUR 320.3 mln.

It was a year in which we made a solid effort to increase our	efficiency	and	improve	our	cost	of	risk.	Compared to last year, the Group also achieved higher relative profitability,	allowing it	to	absorb	any	foreign	currency exchange	rate	fluctuations	successfully. With local funding and hedging solutions in place, Eleving Group is expected to have a limited negative impact on foreign currency exchange rates in the coming years. We also strengthened the Group’s capitalization ratio while maintaining sustainable dividend payout levels. 

During 2023, we continued to diversify our funding structure by raising USD 7 mln from the Verdant Capital Hybrid Fund for the Kenyan portfolio growth. In addition, we successfully continued our Kenyan note program, through which we raised more than EUR 13 mln for business development. Furthermore, in 2023, we established the cooperation with ACP Credit, Central Europe’s	leading	provider	of	financing solutions	for	middle-market businesses. As a result, in early 2024, Mogo Romania received an investment of EUR 10 mln, making it	the	first	time	in	the	Group’s	history	that	a significant external funding partner outside the Mintos marketplace was brought to Mogo Romania. In addition, we continued to	develop	our	electric car-sharing service, OX	Drive,	by raising EUR 2.8 million from Industra Bank to expand its car fleet.		

Of course, one of the highlights of the year was the issuance of the latest Eurobond and subsequent listing on the Baltic and Frankfurt stock exchanges, resulting in EUR 50 mln raised and over 2,000 new investors onboarded. The bond issue was mainly tailored towards the existing investors (both retail and professional ones) from the Baltic states. In terms of volume, this was one of the largest corporate issuances in the Baltics in recent years. Retail investors from Estonia were particularly active. Therefore, we can assume that companies with a strong track record and a healthy balance sheet still have support from local retail investors even in volatile market conditions characterized by an ambiguous investment landscape.

Furthermore, I	would	like	to	note	that	Fitch	Ratings	affirmed Eleving Group’s long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and Senior Secured Debt Rating (SDRR) at ‘B-,’ with a stable outlook. Despite the global economic challenges, we have maintained this performance for the fourth consecutive year.

In conclusion, it was a successful year for the company, 
with healthy growth, sound decisions that delivered expected results,	and	a strong financial position that will contribute to the future sustainable development of our global business.

### 2. Material accounting policy information

#### a) Basis of preparation

These consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2023 are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as
adopted by the European Union (EU).

The Group’s consolidated financial statements and its financial result are affected by accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and management judgement (Note 3), which necessarily have to be made in the course of preparation of the annual consolidated financial statements.


The Group's management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities within the current and next financial period. All estimates
and assumptions required in conformity with IFRS are best estimates undertaken in accordance with the applicable standard. Estimates and judgements are evaluated on a
continuous basis, and are based on past experience and other factors, including expectations with regard to future events. Accounting policies and management’s judgements for
certain items are especially critical for the Group’s results and financial situation due to their materiality. Future events may occur which cause the assumptions used in arriving
at the estimates to change. The effect of any changes in estimates will be recorded in the financial statements, when determinable.

The consolidated financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis as modified by the recognition of financial instruments measured at fair value, and except for
inventory which is accounted in lower of cost or net realizable value and contingent consideration that has been measured at fair value.

Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealized gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated. Unrealized losses are also eliminated. When necessary
amounts reported by subsidiaries have been adjusted to conform to the Group’s accounting policies.

The Group's presentation and functional currency is euro (EUR). The financial statements cover the period from 1 January 2023 till 31 December 2023. Accounting policies and
methods are consistent with those applied in the previous years, except as described below.


The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Eleving Group S.A. (Parent company) and entities controlled by the Parent Company (its subsidiaries)
as at 31 December 2023. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as for the Parent company, using consistent accounting policies.

Control is achieved when the Parent Company is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns
through its power over the investee. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the
subsidiary.

The financial statements of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries are consolidated in the Group’s consolidated financial statements by adding together like items of assets and liabilities as well as income and expense. All intercompany transactions, balances and unrealized gains and losses on transactions between controlled members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation. The equity and net income attributable to non-controlling interests are shown separately in the statement of financial position and the statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income.


A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction. The acquisition of an additional ownership interest in a
subsidiary without a change of control is accounted for as an equity transaction in accordance with IFRS 10. Any excess or deficit of consideration paid over the carrying amount
of the non-controlling interests is recognized in equity of the parent in transactions where the non-controlling interests are acquired or sold without loss of control. The Group
recognizes this effect in retained earnings. If the subsidiary to which these non-controlling interests relate contain accumulated components recognized in other comprehensive
income/ (loss), those are reallocated within equity of the Parent.


If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it:
- Derecognizes the related assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary;
- Derecognizes the carrying amount of any non-controlling interests;
- Derecognizes the cumulative translation differences recorded in equity;
- Recognizes the fair value of the consideration received;
- Recognizes the fair value of any investment retained;
- Recognizes any surplus or deficit in the profit and loss;
- Reclassifies the Group’s share of components previously recognized in other comprehensive income to profit and loss or retained earnings, as appropriate. 


#### Going concern

As the global economy is entering a third year of non-zero key interest rates environment, the Group has managed to post its strongest ever financial results in years 2022 and 2023.

The Group’s product structure allows a significant equity build up during the periods of stable growth. Although the Group largely operates with borrowed capital, the interest
expense forms only 21.27% (in 2022: 19.15%) from its interest revenue. As at 31 December 2023, the principal of Group’s total borrowings amounted to EUR 339.85 million of
which EUR 97.14 million is due for renewal over the following 12 months. The Group’s current assets are EUR 209.56 million, effectively exceeding the principal of borrowings due next 12 months by more than two times. The Group has a track record of successful cash generation and ability to access funding from debt capital markets as well as other sources during protracted periods of economic uncertainty (tested in both 2020 and 2022), hence the Group is expected to meet its funding requirements for the foreseeable future.

Although exposed to external economic environment and indicators, the Group’s portfolio quality is substantially at the control of Group itself as it has the ability to adjust the
underwriting standards on a local basis by geographies and individual products. The result of that is evidenced by substantially improved cost of risk expenses during 2023
indicated by decreasing impairment expenses by 7.94% if compared against 2022 results and that has been achieved despite having higher portfolio by 9% in 2023 versus 2022.

Given the regional diversification of the Group’s business across three continents and Eastern European region being one of them, it is important to highlight that the Group is
not a sanctions target and does not maintain business relations with sanctioned entities. Additionally, two of its subsidiaries in Ukraine and Belarus have been substantially
scaled down without a substantial impact on the overall Group results.

1) In Ukraine the Group is focused on collection activities only. The collected funds are being partially repatriated with remainder temporarily being housed in the country. The
funds collected as well as temporarily housed in country are not material for the Group and its going concern operations.

2) In January 2024, the Group received all the necessary approval from Belarusian government authorities with respect to sale of entities in Belarus. The sale is expected to be
finished with 2024 once all aspects of the transaction, including asset refinance, will be implemented. For reporting purposes, Mogo Belarus is classified as a discontinued
operation.

These consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis.

### 2. Material accounting policy information (continued)

The following amendments are effective for the period beginning 1 January 2023:

- IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts;
- Disclosure of Accounting Policies (Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IFRS Practice Statement 2 Making Materiality Judgements);
- Definition of Accounting Estimates (Amendments to IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors);
- Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction (Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes); and
- International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules (Amendment to IAS 12 Income Taxes) (effective immediately upon the issue of the amendments and retrospectively).

These amendments to various IFRS Accounting Standards are mandatorily effective for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023. See the applicable notes for
further details on how the amendments affected the Group.


#### IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts


IFRS 17 was issued by the IASB in 2017 and replaces IFRS 4 for annual reporting period beginning on or after 1 January 2023. IFRS 17 introduces an internationally consistent approach to the accounting for insurance contracts. Prior to IFRS 17, significant diversity has existed worldwide relating to the accounting for and disclosure of insurance contracts, with IFRS 4 permitting many previous accounting approaches to be followed. 

Since IFRS 17 applies to all insurance contracts issued by an entity (with limited scope exclusions), its adoption may have an effect on non-insurers such as Eleving Group. The
Group carried out an assessment of its contracts and operations and concluded that the adoption of IFRS 17 has had no effect on the consolidated financial statements of the
Group.


#### Disclosure of Accounting Policies (Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IFRS Practice Statement 2 Making Materiality Judgements)

In February 2021, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2. The amendments aim to make accounting policy disclosures more informative by replacing the requirement to disclose ‘significant accounting policies’ with ‘material accounting policy information’. The amendments also provide guidance under what circumstance, the accounting policy information is likely to be considered material and therefore requiring disclosure. 

These amendments have no effect on the measurement or presentation of any items in the Consolidated financial statements of the Group but affect the disclosure of accounting policies of the Group.

#### Definition of Accounting Estimates (Amendments to IAS 8 Accounting policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors) 

The amendments to IAS 8, which added the definition of accounting estimates, clarify that the effects of a change in an input or measurement technique are changes in
accounting estimates, unless resulting from the correction of prior period errors. These amendments clarify how entities make the distinction between changes in accounting
estimate, changes in accounting policy and prior period errors.

These amendments had no effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.


#### Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction (Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes) 

In May 2021, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 12, which clarify whether the initial recognition exemption applies to certain transactions that result in both an asset and a
liability being recognised simultaneously (e.g. a lease in the scope of IFRS 16). The amendments introduce an additional criterion for the initial recognition exemption, whereby
the exemption does not apply to the initial recognition of an asset or liability which at the time of the transaction, gives rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary
differences.

These amendments had no effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.


####  International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules (Amendment to IAS 12 Income Taxes)

In December 2021, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released a draft legislative framework for a global minimum tax that is expected to be used by individual jurisdictions. The goal of the framework is to reduce the shifting of profit from one jurisdiction to another in order to reduce global tax obligations in corporate structures. In March 2022, the OECD released detailed technical guidance on Pillar Two of the rules. 

Stakeholders raised concerns with the IASB about the potential implications on income tax accounting, especially accounting for deferred taxes, arising from the Pillar Two model rules. The IASB issued the final Amendments (the Amendments) International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules, in response to stakeholder concerns on 23 May 2023.

The Amendments introduce a mandatory exception to entities from the recognition and disclosure of information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two model rules. The exception is effective immediately and retrospectively. The Amendments also provide for additional disclosure requirements with respect to an entity’s exposure
to Pillar Two income taxes.

Management of the Group has determined that the Group is not within the scope of OECD’s Pillar Two Model Rules and the exception to the recognition and disclosure of information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes is not applicable to the Group since it does not exceed threshold of revenue of 750 million EUR.

### 2. Material accounting policy information (continued)

####  d) New standards, interpretations and amendments not yet effective

There are a number of standards, amendments to standards, and interpretations which have been issued by the IASB that are effective in future accounting periods that the
Group has decided not to adopt early. 

The following amendments are effective for the period beginning 1 January 2024:

- Liability in a Sale and Leaseback (Amendments to IFRS 16 Leases);
- Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current (Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements);
- Non-current Liabilities with Covenants (Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements); and
- Supplier Finance Arrangements (Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures)

The following amendments are effective for the period beginning 1 January 2025:

Lack of Exchangeability (Amendments to IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates)

The Group is currently assessing the impact of these new accounting standards and amendments. The Group does not believe that the amendments to IAS 1 will have a 
significant impact on the classification of its liabilities. The Group does not expect any other standards issued by the IASB, but are yet to be effective, to have a material impact 
on the Group.



#### e) Reclassification of comparative indicators

As described in Note 20, in 2024 the Group sold all its subsidiaries in Belarus therefore has reclassified their results to discontinued operations. This resulted in change in
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss and Other Comprehensive Income as well as in Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

The Group also identified that in 2022 it had misstated the deferred tax asset. This also was amended in restated figures of 2022.

####  Foreign currency translation									

The consolidated financial statements are presented in euro (EUR), which is the presentation currency of the Group. EUR is the monetary unit of Luxembourg, where the Parent Company is established. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the euro at the reference exchange rate fixed by the European Central Bank at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into EUR applying the reference exchange rate established by the European Central Bank at the last day of the reporting year. The differences arising on settlements of transactions or on reporting foreign currency transactions at rates different from those at which these transactions have originally been recorded in the profit and loss and presented within finance costs.									

Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. The non-monetary items are carried at historical cost and no further retranslation is performed.

For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations except non-monetary items, valued at historical exchange rate are translated into euros at the rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting date and their statements of profit and loss and other comprehensive income are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the dates of transactions. If subsidiary’s functional currency differs from the presentation currency of the Group, income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuated significantly during the period, in which case the currency exchange rates at the date of the transactions are applied. The exchange differences arising on translation for consolidation are recognized in other comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign operation, the component of other comprehensive income relating to that particular foreign operation is reclassified in profit or loss.

####  Business combinations

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, including contingent consideration, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. For each business combination, the Group elects whether it measures the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included in other operating expense in the statement of profit and loss.

When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.


If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date and any difference is recognized in profit and loss. 


If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports in its financial statements provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. During the measurement period, the Group will retrospectively adjust the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. During the measurement period, the Group will also recognize additional assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and, if known, would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities as of that date. The measurement period ends as soon as the Group receives the information it was seeking about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or learns that more information is not obtainable. However, the measurement period shall not exceed one year from the acquisition date. 

Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability will be recognized in accordance with IFRS 9 in profit or loss. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it will not be remeasured. Subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. In instances where the contingent consideration does not fall within the scope of IFRS 9, it is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date and subsequent changes in fair value are recognized in profit or loss.

#### Discontinued operations

A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business, the operations and cash flows of which can be clearly distinguished from the rest of the Group and which:
– represents a separate major line of business or geographic area of operations;
– is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographic area of operations; or
– is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.
Classification as a discontinued operation occurs at the earlier of disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held-for-sale.
When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative statement of profit or loss and OCI is re-presented as if the operation had been discontinued from the start of the comparative year.

#### Goodwill

Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognized for non-controlling interests, over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If this consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the gain is recognized in profit or loss statement immediately.

Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. The Group tests goodwill for impairment at least annually and whenever there are indications that goodwill may be impaired. Goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating units. Such units represent the smallest groups of assets that generate cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets or CGUs. Measurement of gains or losses on disposal of an operation within a cash generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated include the carrying amount of goodwill associated with the disposed operation, generally measured on the basis of the relative values of the disposed operation and the portion of the cash-generating unit which is retained. Impairment is recognized whenever the carrying value of CGU to which goodwill is allocated is above the recoverable value of such CGU.

The recoverable amount of cash generating units has been determined based on value in use calculations. These calculations require the use of estimates as disclosed in Note
21.


####  Internally generated intangible assets

Internally generated intangible assets primarily include the development costs of the Group's information management systems. These costs are capitalized only if they satisfy the criteria as defined by IAS38 and described below.

Internal and external development costs on management information systems arising from the development phase are capitalized. Significant maintenance and improvement costs are added to the initial cost of assets if they specifically meet the capitalization criteria.

Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. Internally generated intangible assets cost value is increased by Group's information technology costs - salaries and social security contribution capitalization. All other expenditure is recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Asset useful life is reassessed by management at each year end and amortization periods adapted accordingly.

Internally generated intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives of 7 years. The main internally generated intangible assets are CRM systems.

According to IAS38, development costs shall be capitalized if, and only if, the Group can meet all of the following criteria:
- the project is clearly identified and the related costs are itemized and reliably monitored;
- the technical and industrial feasibility of completing the project is demonstrated;
- there is a clear intention to complete the project and to use or sell the intangible asset arising from it;
- the Group has the ability to use or sell the intangible asset arising from the project;
- the Group can demonstrate how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits;
- the Group has adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the project and to use or sell the intangible asset.

When these conditions are not satisfied, development costs generated by the Group are recognized as an expense when incurred. Following initial recognition of the development expenditure as an asset, the asset is carried at cost less any accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Amortization of the asset begins when development is completed and the asset is available for use.
Additional information is included in Notes 3 and 21.

Amortization is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows:

 IT systems - over 7 years.


#### Other intangible assets

Other intangible non-current assets are stated at cost and amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis. The carrying values of intangible assets are
reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Losses from impairment are recognized where the carrying value of intangible non-current assets exceeds their recoverable amount.
Other intangible assets mainly consists of acquired computer software products.

Amortization is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows:

 Concessions, patents, licences and similar rights - over 1 year;
 Internally developed intangible assets	- over 7 years;	
 Other intangible assets - over 2 to 7 years.	

Trademarks, licenses and customer contracts (if separable) acquired in a business combination are recognized at fair value at the acquisition date.

Trademarks are used to identify and distinguish specific brand names of companies. The rights to use brand names have a set expiry date, however it is renewable at a notional
cost. The group intends to renew the trademark continuously and past evidence supports its ability to do so. An analysis of future cash flows provides evidence that the brands
will generate net cash inflows for the group for an indefinite period. Therefore, the trademarks are considered to have infinite useful lives and are measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses if the recoverable amount is lower than carrying value. Such impairment testing is done annually by allocating trademarks to relevant CGUs and
estimating their value in use (VIU). Please see Note 21 for further details.

### 2. Material accounting policy information (continued)

#### Property, plant and equipment


Equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as described below. If significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, then they are accounted for as separate items:


 Computers - over 3 years;	
 Furniture - over 5 years;	
 Vehicles - over 5 years;	
 Leasehold improvements - over lease term;	
 Other equipment - over 2 years.	


Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only then when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the statement of comprehensive income during the financial period in which they are incurred.


Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use, i.e. when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. The carrying values of equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists and where the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount, the assets or cash-generating units are written down to their recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of equipment is the higher of an asset’s fair value less cost to sell and its value in use. In assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Impairment losses are recognized in the statement of profit and loss in the impairment expense caption.

An item of equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item) is included in the statement of profit and loss in the year the item is derecognized.

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate.



#### Rental fleet

Rental fleet includes assets leased by the Group (as lessor) under operating leases. Group accounts for the underlying assets in accordance with IAS 16. Depreciation policy for
the underlying assets subject to operating leases is consistent with the Group’s depreciation policy for similar assets (vehicles) and amounts to 7 years.

Group adds initial direct costs, including The Global Positioning System (GPS) costs and dealership commissions, incurred in obtaining the operating lease to the carrying amount of the underlying asset and recognizes those costs as an expense over the lease term on the same basis as the lease income.

The Group applies the general principles described under ‘Significant accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions’ (Note 3) to determine whether an underlying asset subject to an operating lease may have residual value unrecoverable and impairment loss may need to be recognized.

#### Financial assets

Financial instruments – initial recognition

Date of recognition
Loans and advances to customers are recognized when funds are transferred to the customers’ accounts. Other assets are recognized on the date when Group enters into the
contract giving rise to the financial instruments.

Initial measurement of financial instruments

The classification of financial instruments at initial recognition depends on their contractual terms and the business model for managing the instruments, as described further in the accounting policies. Financial instruments are initially measured at their fair value (which is generally equal to the transaction price) adjusted for transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue, except in the case of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at FVPL. 

Classification of financial assets

The Group measures Loans and advances to customers, Loans to related parties, Receivables from related parties, cash equivalents and Other loans and receivables at amortized cost if both of the following conditions are met:
- The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows
- The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount
outstanding.


All financial assets not classified as measured at amortised cost as described above are measured at FVTPL. This includes all derivative financial assets. On initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.

### 2. Material accounting policy information (continued)

Business model assessment

The Group determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of financial assets to achieve its business objective - the risks that affect the
performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and the way those risks are managed. The frequency, volume and timing of sales
in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and its expectations about future sales activity are also important aspects of the Group’s assessment. However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the Group’s stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash
flows are realised. The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking 'worst case' or 'stress case’ scenarios into account. If cash flows
after initial recognition are realized in a way that is different from the Group's original expectations, the Group does not change the classification of the remaining financial assets
held in that business model, but incorporates such information when assessing newly originated or newly purchased financial assets going forward. The assessed business model is with the intention to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows. Sales that take place from these portfolios relate to credit events. Loans from portfolios might be sold to debt collector agencies when underlying debtors have defaulted on their obligations. When, and only when, an entity changes its business model for managing financial assets it shall reclassify all affected financial assets. No financial liability reclassifications take place.

SPPI test

As a second step of its classification process the Group assesses, where relevant, the contractual terms of the financial assets to identify whether they meet the SPPI test.
Financial assets subject to SPPI testing are loans and advances to customers (including financial assets arising from sales and leaseback transactions, as discussed in a separate section of this note) and loans to related parties that solely include payments of principal and interest. ‘Principal’ for the purpose of this test is defined as the fair value of the
financial asset at initial recognition and may change over the life of the financial asset (for example, if there are repayments of principal or amortization of the premium/discount). The most significant elements of interest within a lending arrangement are typically the consideration for the time value of money and credit risk.

In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are SPPI, the Group considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition.
In making the assessment, the Group principally considers:
   -  contingent events that would change the amount and timing of cash flows;
   -  prepayment and extension terms; and
   - terms that limit the Group’s claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse loans).
   
   
   
   In general, the loan contracts stipulate that in case of default and collateral repossession the claim is not limited to the collateral repossession and if the collateral value does not cover the remaining debt, additional resources can still be claimed from the borrower to compensate for credit risk losses. Accordingly, this aspect does not create obstacles to passing SPPI test. However, in some cases, loans made by the Group that are secured by collateral of the borrower limit the Group’s claim to cash flows of the underlying collateral (non-recourse loans). The group applies judgment in assessing whether the non-recourse loans meet the SPPI criterion. The Group typically considers the following information when making this judgement:
   - whether the contractual arrangement specifically defines the amounts and dates of the cash payments of the loan;
   - the fair value of the collateral relative to the amount of the underlying loan; 
   - the ability and willingness of the borrower to make contractual payments, notwithstanding a decline in the value of collateral;
   - the Group’s risk of loss on the asset relative to a full-recourse loan; and 
   - whether the Group will benefit from any upside from the underlying assets.
   
 
Embedded derivatives

The Group has certain call and put option agreements that can accelerate repayment of the issued bonds. These options arise out of bond (host contract) prospectus and
individual agreements with certain bondholders and meet the definition of an embedded derivative in accordance with IFRS 9. An embedded derivative is a component of a hybrid instrument that also includes a non-derivative host contract with the effect that some of the cash flows of the combined instrument vary in a way similar to a stand-alone
derivative. An embedded derivative causes some or all of the cash flows that otherwise would be required by the contract to be modified according to a specified interest rate,
financial instrument price, commodity price, foreign exchange rate, index of prices or rates, credit rating or credit index, or other variable, provided that, in the case of a nonfinancial variable, it is not specific to a party to the contract. A derivative that is attached to a financial instrument, but is contractually transferable independently of that
instrument, or has a different counterparty from that instrument, is not an embedded derivative, but a separate financial instrument. The Group accounts for an embedded
derivative separately from the host contract when:
- the host contract is not an asset in the scope of IFRS 9;
- the host contract is not itself carried at FVPL;
- the terms of the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative if they were contained in a separate contract; and
- the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract.


Separated embedded derivatives are measured at fair value, with all changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss (unless they form part of a qualifying cash flow or net
investment hedging relationship) and presented in the statement of financial position together with the host contract. The Group has derivatives embedded in financial liabilities and non-financial host contracts, see further information under 'Separation of embedded derivatives from the host contract' (Note 3). Financial assets are classified based on the business model and SPPI assessments as outlined above. Please refer to Note 3 for further discussion on embedded derivative details and considerations of separability.


The Group also has receivables recognized at fair value due to them containing a derivative element. When measuring the fair value of an asset, the Group uses observable
market data as far as possible. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques.


Reclassification of financial assets

The Group does not reclassify its financial assets subsequent to their initial recognition, apart from the exceptional circumstances in which the Group acquires, disposes of, or
terminates a business line and changes its business model for managing financial assets. Financial liabilities are never reclassified. The Group did not reclassify any of its financial assets or liabilities in 2023 nor 2022.

####  Derecognition of financial assets and finance lease receivables

Derecognition provisions below apply to all financial assets measured at amortized cost. 

Derecognition due to substantial modification of terms and conditions

The Group derecognizes a loan to a customer or a finance lease receivable when the terms and conditions have been renegotiated to the extent that, substantially, it becomes a
new loan or lease, with the difference recognized as a derecognition gain or loss, to the extent that an impairment loss has not already been recorded. The newly recognized
loans are classified as Stage 1 for ECL measurement purposes, unless the new financial asset is deemed to be purchased or originated credit impaired (POCI).

When assessing whether or not to derecognize a financial asset, the Group evaluates whether the cash flows of the modified asset are substantially different and the Group
considers the following qualitative factors:
- Change in currency of the loan
- Change in counterparty
- If the modification is such that the instrument would no longer meet the SPPI criterion for financial asset
- Whether legal obligations have been extinguished.
- Furthermore, for loans to customers and financial lease receivables the Group specifically considers the purpose of the modification for increase in loan principal. It is
evaluated whether modification was entered into for commercial reasons upon customer initiative or for credit restructuring reasons. 


Management has performed analysis of the changes being made due to business reasons and evaluated that changes due to business reasons result in substantial modification of
terms and conditions. This is in line with the objective of this modification that is to originate a new asset with substantially different present value of expected cash flows. If the
customer was not in delay, and the principal was increase on a mutual agreement, the respective modification is considered to occur for a commercial reasons and results in
derecognition of the initial lease/loan receivable.
Other modifications to the agreement terms are treated as modifications that do not result in derecognition (see section on Modifications below).


Derecognition other than for substantial modification

A financial asset or finance lease receivable (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or finance lease receivable or part of a group of similar financial assets or finance lease receivables) is derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset or finance lease receivable have expired. The Group also derecognizes the
financial asset or finance lease receivable if it has both transferred the financial asset or finance lease receivable and the transfer qualifies for derecognition. The Group has transferred the financial asset or finance lease receivable if the Group has transferred its contractual rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset or
finance lease receivable.

The Group has transferred the asset if, and only if, either:
- The Group has transferred its contractual rights to receive cash flows from the asset or
- It retains the rights to the cash flows, but has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass–through’
arrangement.

Pass-through arrangements are transactions when Group retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of a financial asset (the 'original asset'), but assumes a
contractual obligation to pay those cash flows to one or more entities (the 'eventual recipients'), when all of the following three conditions are met:
- Group has no obligation to pay amounts to the eventual recipients unless it has collected equivalent amounts from the original asset, excluding short-term advances by the
entity with the right of full recovery of the amount lent plus accrued interest at market rates;
- Group cannot sell or pledge the original asset other than as security to the eventual recipients for the obligation to pay them cash flows;
- Group has to remit any cash flows it collects on behalf of the eventual recipients without material delay. In addition, the Group is not entitled to reinvest such cash flows,
except for investments in cash or cash equivalents during the short settlement period from the collection date to the date of required remittance to the eventual recipients, and
interest earned on such investments is passed to the eventual recipients.


A transfer only qualifies for derecognition if either:
- The Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or
- The Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.




####  Modifications


The Group sometimes makes modifications to the original terms of loans/lease as a response to the borrower’s financial difficulties, rather than taking possession or to otherwise
enforce collection of collateral. The Group considers a lease/loan restructured when such modifications are provided as a result of the borrower’s present or expected financial
difficulties and the Group would not have agreed to them if the borrower had been financially healthy. Indicators of financial difficulties include default or DPDs prior to the
modifications. Such modifications may involve extending the payment arrangements and the agreement of new loan conditions.


If the modification does not result in cash flows that are substantially different, as set out in the preceding section, the modification does not result in derecognition. Based on
the change in cash flows discounted at the original EIR, the Group records a modification gain or loss in interest revenue/expenses calculated using the effective interest method (Note 4, 5) in the consolidated statements of profit and loss, to the extent that an impairment loss has not already been recorded (Note 7). Further information on modified financial assets and finance lease receivables is disclosed in the following section on impairment.


Further, as described in section on 'Derecognition due to substantial modification of terms and conditions' if modification is performed for commercial reasons, then it is
considered to result in derecognition of the initial lease/loan receivable. Such modifications include increase in the lease amount and increase in lease term, which are agreed
upon with customers for commercial reasons (i.e.-, customers and the Group are both interested in substantially modifying the scope of the lease/loan transaction). Whenever
such an agreement to modify is reached the old agreement and respective receivable is derecognized.

### 2. Material accounting policy information (continued)

Treatment of non-substantial modifications

If expectations of fixed rate financial assets’ cash flows (such assets present core part of Group' s financial asset base) are revised for reasons other than credit risk, then changes to future contractual cash flows are discounted at the original EIR with a consequential adjustment to the carrying amount. The difference from the previous carrying amount is booked as a positive or negative adjustment to the carrying amount of the financial asset on the consolidated statement of financial position with a corresponding increase or decrease in Interest revenue/expense calculated using the effective interest method.

The carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability is adjusted if the Group revises its estimates of payments or receipts. If modification of a financial asset or liability
measured at amortized cost does not result in the derecognition a modification gain/loss is calculated. The adjusted carrying amount is calculated based on the revised effective interest rate and the change in carrying amount is recorded as interest income or expense.


Changes in the contractual cash flows of the asset are recognized in statement of profit and loss and any costs or fees incurred adjust the carrying amount of the modified
financial asset and are amortized over the remaining term of the modified instrument. Therefore, the original EIR determined at initial recognition is revised on modification to
reflect any costs or fees incurred.

####  Overview of the expected credit loss principles

The Group recognizes the allowance for expected credit losses for all loans and other debt financial assets not held at FVPL and finance lease receivables (as due to lease contract
specifics lease receivable does not contain any unguaranteed residual value, IFRS 9 provisions apply to full finance lease receivable balance). In this section all referred to as
‘financial instruments’.

If there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, the ECL allowance is based on the 12 months’ expected credit loss (12mECL) as outlined in below. If
there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, the ECL allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (the lifetime
expected credit loss or LTECL). The Group’s policies for determining if there has been a significant increase in credit risk are set out in below.

The 12mECL is the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting
date. Both LTECLs and 12mECLs are calculated on either an individual basis or a collective basis, depending on the nature of the underlying portfolio of financial instruments.


The Group has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of whether a financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. This is further explained in section on Significant
increase in credit risk (Note 3).


#### Impairment of finance lease receivables and loans and advances to customers

**Defining credit rating**

The Group’s core business assets – financial lease receivables and loans and advances to customers – are of retail nature, they are therefore grouped per countries and products (finance lease receivables and loans and advances to customers) for a collective ECL calculation that is modelled based on DPD (days past due) classification. Specifically, the
Group analyzes its portfolio of finance lease receivables and loans and advances to customers by segregating receivables in categories according to: country, product group, days
past due and presence of underlying collateral (for secured products). Financial lease receivables and secured loans (more specifically vehicle secured loans) are combined
together due to similar nature of the products.

The Group continuously monitors all assets subject to ECLs. In order to determine whether an instrument or a portfolio of instruments is subject to 12m ECL or LTECL, the Group
assesses whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. When estimating ECLs on a collective basis for a group of similar assets, the Group
applies the same principles for assessing whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition across the portfolios within the country based on
product type – lease or loan product.

The Group segregates finance lease receivables and loans and advances to customers in the following categories:

Finance lease receivables and secured loans (mature countries*):									
1) Not past due									
2) Days past due up to 30 days									
3) Days past due 31 up to 60 days									
4) Days past due over 60 days									
5) unsecured (general definition: days past due over 90 or collateral is not available, i.e. lost or sold).		

* - Matured countries - Operations in Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Georgia, Armenia, Romania, Moldova. Operations in these countries are the longest, with the smoothest processes, therefore consistent lending practices in these countries have a long enough track record. Refer to Eleving Vehicle Finance only.

#### pg:80


### 2. Material accounting policy information (continued)


Finance lease receivables and secured loans (non-mature countries*):									
1) Not past due									
2) Days past due up to 25 days (up to 30 days for Africa region)									
3) Days past due 26 up to 34 days (31 - 34 days for Africa region)									
4) Days past due over 35 days									
5) unsecured (general definition: days past due over 90 or collateral is not available, i.e. lost or sold).									
									
* - Non-matured countries - Operations in Kenya, Uganda and Uzbekistan. Refer to Eleving Vehicle Finance only.									
									
Loans and advances to customers (unsecured loans, refer to Eleving Vehicle Finance only):									
1) Not past due									
2) Days past due up to 30 days									
3) Days past due 31 up to 60 days									
4) Days past due over 60 days									
									
Loans and advances to customers (unsecured loans, acquired businesses*):									
1) Not past due									
2) Days past due up to 30 days									
3) Days past due 31 up to 60 days									
4) Days past due 61 up to 90 days									
5) Days past due over 90 days									



* - Businesses acquired during 2020 and 2023 – the term refers to unsecured consumer lending companies acquired in 2020 and 2023; acquired companies operate in Moldova, Ukraine, North Macedonia, Albania, Namibia, Botswana, Zambia and Lesotho. Term is introduced to distinguish unsecured consumer lending operations in these countries from Eleving greenfield investments into unsecured consumer lending operations in Latvia, Estonia, Armenia and Lithuania as there are differences in product set up and processes.									
															
Before the acquisition of consumer unsecured portfolios, the Group made due diligence on the impairment of respective portfolios. It was concluded that applied methodology is inline with the IFRS9 standard, it is well aligned with debt collections and other critical business processes and it is quite prudent. Although methodology differed from the one applied for Mogo unsecured portfolios it was decided to keep the applied methodology.									
									
														
Based on the above process, the Group groups its leases and loans into Stage 1, Stage 2, and Stage 3, as described below:									
The Group defines staging predominantly based on DPD and aligns it with the debt collections processes. For more accurate ECL assessment, split by stages is enhanced by healing bucket concept to reflect on cases when DPD is not a sufficient indicator of credit risk. This is applicable to lease portfolios and car loans (unsecured consumer loan where clients borrow a sum of money in order to purchase a car).									
									
The Group’s experience in lending suggests that DPD is a strong predictor of a credit default, thus DPD is the main quantitative factor for the backstop identification for Stage 2. Data from the Groups active vehicle operations (active 3+ years) shows that probability to reach default status over the next 12 months horizon is quite low for accounts which have 0 DPD and merely low for accounts with delay up to 30 DPD. Respective probabilities are higher for immature markets due to very strict default definition at 35 DPD. Additionally, debt collection process is structured in such way that the Group actively works with delaying clients at least 30 days. Recovery results show ~90% cure rate within 30 days for regular invoices. However, accounts with DPD 30 and more demonstrate probability to default within the next 12 months above 50% and thus based on the Group’s management judgement clearly have signs of SICR.									
												
									
The Group applies the rule that not more than 30 DPD should trigger backstop and transfer to Stage 2. It is set 30 DPD for matured countries lease portfolios, for African countries lease portfolios and consumer loan portfolios. For the sake of alignment with default definition for immature countries lease portfolios backstop is 25 DPD.  Additionally, to reflect on significant increase in credit risk (SICR) in the case when DPD is not a sufficient indicator the Group have introduced Healing state.									
									
																
Healing state concept is applied for lease assets and car loans, and it is applied in the case of:									
- Lease contract recoveries during middle DC stage – after 30 delay days for matured counties and after 26 delay days for immature (2 months period from reporting date is observed).
- Lease contract delaying 26-30 days for immature countries.
- Lease contract renewal after termination or theoretical renewal (returning to active portfolio without terminating the agreement) after default (including countries without termination functionality). In these cases, 2 months period from reporting date is observed.
- Only for immature Africa’s countries – restructurings due to credit reasons. In 2021 year, the Group decided to supplement healing bucket definition for Africa’s countries as a reaction on massive usage of such amendments as an effective DC tool. At current stage the Group cannot evaluate increase in credit risk for such cases due to insufficient history, therefor uses more prudent approach for balance staging.									
In such cases the exposures are included in Stage 2 for a period of two months. Afterwards SICR related to the event is settled and exposure is allocated to the stage based on DPD.

#### pg:81


### 2. Material accounting policy information (continued)


- Stage 1: When loans/leases are first recognized, the Group recognizes an allowance based on 12mECLs. The Group considers leases and loans that are current or with DPD up to 30 (up to 25 DPD in non-mature countries) as Stage 1. A healing period of 2 months is applied before an exposure previously classified as Stage 2 can be transferred to Stage 1 and such an exposure must meet the general Stage 1 DPD criteria above. Healing period concept is applicable to lease portfolios and car loans. Exposures are classified out of Stage 1 if they no longer meet the criteria above.
- Stage 2: When a loan/lease has shown a significant increase in credit risk since origination, the Group records an allowance for the LTECLs. The Group generally considers leases, secured loans and car loans that have a status of 31-60 DPD (matured countries) and 26-34 DPD (non-matured countries) to being Stage 2. An unsecured loan is considered Stage 2 if DPD is in the range of 30 to 60 or 30 to 90 days for acquired businesses. Lease exposures remain in Stage 2 for a healing period of 2 months, even if they otherwise would meet Stage 1 criteria above during this period.
- Stage 3: Leases and loans considered credit-impaired and at default. The Group records an allowance for the LTECLs. The Group considers a finance lease agreement, secured loan and car loans agreement defaulted and therefore Stage 3 in all cases when the borrower becomes 61 DPD (matured countries) or 35 DPD (non-matured countries) on its contractual payments or the lease/ loan agreement is terminated. The Group considers an unsecured loan agreement defaulted and therefore Stage 3 in all cases when the borrower becomes 91 days past due for acquired businesses on its contractual payments.								
									
													
The difference in default definition for unsecured consumer loan agreements is driven by different business processes, product set up and development history in greenfield and acquired operations. Debt collections practices applied in Latvia, Estonia, Armenia and Lithuania for leases and secured loans were transferred to unsecured operations, thus active in-house debt collections process runs until DPD 60. After that exposure is either sold, or legal execution starts, or settlement process is enabled. Acquired businesses have active in-house debt collections process running until DPD 90. After that exposure is transferred to external agencies for the debt collections. Later it is either sold or legal execution starts.				


####  Macroeconomic shocks, geopolitical crisis, and other unpredictable situations: business adoption and reflection in Impairment, impact on SICR.									
									
The first years of this decade have heralded a particularly disruptive period in human history. The return to a “new normal” following the COVID-19 pandemic was quickly disrupted by the outbreak of war in Ukraine, ushering in a fresh series of crises in food and energy – triggering problems that decades of progress had sought to solve. Majority of Group Countries returned to “older” risks as inflation, cost-of-living crises, widespread social unrest, geopolitical confrontation which negatively impacted Group’s operations and caused increase in credit risk.									
									
													
Analysing and evaluating Group’s responses to such non-standard situations in past, management decided to keep and maintain introduced during Covid-19 pandemic so-called TDR (temporary debt restructuring) program. Forbearance tools (TDR and restructuring, i.e., change of the original payment schedule) is almost the only feasible solution to reduce financial burden on customers crisis circumstances, thus fact of the forbearance as such does not lead to the recognition of SICR if customer pays according to new terms and later returns to the original schedule or close to it. 
Following the crisis situation Group’s management might decide to activate TDR program for certain market for defined period (from 3 to 6 months).  In mentioned situation – cases where the Group has sound grounds to expect customer to return to the regular discipline not longer than in 12-month time should not be classified as SICR even if customer has been granted forbearance tool.									
									
											
									
Temporary debt restructuring (TDR) and other forbearance tools:									
1. Alternative schedule (AS) – a temporary reduction of monthly payment, typically not more than 50%.  Customers use this option for several, e.g. 3-6 months in row.					2. Extension – is a payment holiday for 1 month. Customer pays extension fee (in some cases free extensions are possible) and returns to the original schedule in next 1-3 months.
3. Restructurings – permanent amendment of the schedule (term end increase, monthly payment decrease, interest decrease).									
TDR is granted upon customer’s request. Customer is on TDR program if he complies with agreed terms (no SICR is recognized). If terms are breached customer returns to the original schedule and his credit risk is assessed as per actual DPD. 									


The calculation of ECLs			

The Group calculates ECLs based on probability-weighted scenarios to measure the expected cash shortfalls, discounted at an approximation to the EIR.
A cash shortfall is the difference between the cash flows that are due to the Group in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive.
Key elements of the model are, as follows:
- PD The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a 12 month or lifetime horizon (time horizon depends on ECL type - i.e. 12mECL or LTECL); 
- the Default distribution vector (DDV) is the estimate of the time to default, more specifically it provides distribution of PD over the course of a 12 month or lifetime horizon; Specifically, how many defaulted loans during 12 months/ lifetime defaulted during 1st, 2nd, 3rd etc. month started from certain moment of time (evaluation starting point);
- EAD The Exposure at Default is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, considering expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise;
- LGD The Loss Given Default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the cash flows due at the moment of default and those that the lender would expect to receive, including from the realization of any collateral and deducting expenses related to cash collections or collateral realization processes. It is usually expressed as a percentage of the defaulted balance;
- lifetime period is estimated as average remaining contractual term of respective portfolio.							
								
									
The Group may choose to use actual balance instead of EAD and do not apply DDV for the segments with the elevated credit risk. 
Significant judgments used for determining PD and LGD are described in Note 3.		

									
The Group employs multiplication model across all Stages for the ECL calculation: 									
ECL=EAD*PD*LGD*[DDV]									
									
Given that DDV is a multidimensional vector (generally 12 or 13 dimensions, but can be shorter if representative historical data is available for s a shorter period ) it is aggregated into one value before multiplication - [DDV]. DDV aggregated value is obtained as follows:	

- each value of the DDV is multiplied with discount factor; 
- discount factor is calculated in a regular way (e.g. NPV formula), where discount is calculated on EIR of the portfolio and number of periods corresponds to the dimension of     the respective DDV value;
- [DDV] is the sum of all respective multiplications of DDV values with respective discount factors.							
									

 82

#### pg:82 

### 2. Material accounting policy information (continued)

Depending on the Stage the following specifics are applied to the general ECL model: 
- Stage 1: The 12mECL is calculated. The Group calculates the 12mECL allowance using 12 months (or shorter if lifetime of the product is less than 12 months) PDs and DDV
over the 12-month horizon. These 12-month default probabilities are applied to an estimated EAD and multiplied by the expected LGD and discounted by an approximation to the original EIR using DDV, in this way incorporating time to default into model.
- Stage 2: When a loan has shown a significant increase in credit risk since origination, the Group records an allowance for the LTECLs. The mechanics are like those explained
above, but PDs and DDV are estimated over the lifetime of the instrument. The expected cash shortfalls are discounted by an approximation to the original EIR using DDV.
- Stage 3: For loans considered credit-impaired, the Group recognizes the LTECLs for these loans. The method is similar to that for Stage 2 assets, with the PD set at 100%.


ECL on restructured and modified loans

Some types of modifications performed to customers that serve to renegotiate terms of an agreement that was previously in default result in continued Stage 3 treatment during the one month healing period for mature countries followed by 2 months of healing period in Stage 2. For immature countries due to the nature of the default definition and lack of ability to renew terminated agreements, exposure enters Stage 2 directly. In case of modification for credit reasons prior to default (generally term extension), exposure is moved to Stage 2 for a healing period of 2 months.

Write off of unrecoverable debts

The Group considers any kind of receivable completely unrecoverable and writes off the receivable from balance sheet entirely if all legal actions have been performed to recover the receivable and the Group has no reasonable expectations of recovering the exposure.


#### Impairment of contract assets and financial assets other than lease receivables and loans and advances to customers

Further financial assets where the Group calculates ECL on an individual basis or collective basis are:									
- Other receivables from customers/contract assets - on collective basis;
- Loans and advance payments to related parties - on individual basis;
- Trade receivables - on collective basis;
- Cash and cash equivalents - on individual basis;
- Deposits - on individual basis.	

Financial assets are aggregated in categories considering the similarities of key risk characteristics and nature of each of these.

The Group assesses the impairment for  other receivables from customers/contract assets on a collective basis at country level. For the rest of financial assets other than finance lease receivables and loans and advances to customers the Group calculates ECL on an individual basis.

Impairment of other receivables from customers/contract assets

During the course of business, the Group may have other type of claims against its leasing customers. In such cases, considering the portfolio features, the ECL methodology of
the related lease receivable is mirrored and the ECL mirrors the impairment of the lease receivable. The Group considers other receivables from customers/contract assets that are current or with DPD up to 25 as Stage 1. A healing period of 5 days is applied before an exposure previously classified as Stage 2 can be transferred to Stage 1. The Group generally considers other receivables from customers/contract assets that have a status of 26-34 DPD to be Stage 2 loans. The Group considers financial assets defaulted and therefore Stage 3 in all cases when the borrower becomes 35 DPD.

For other receivables and contract assets that are not related to lease portfolio receivables, the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognizes a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The ECL recorded is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment.

Impairment for loans and advance payments to related parties, trade receivables

Receivables from related parties inherently are subject to the Group’s credit risk. Therefore, a benchmarked PD and LGD rate - based on Standard & Poor's corporate statistics studies has been applied in determining the ECLs. For related party exposures Stage 2 and lifetime ECL calculation is applied based on 30 day back stop and 90 day back stop is applied to Stage 3 determination. Further qualitative factors evaluated include extension of the payment terms granted, previous arrears in the last 12 months and significant adverse changes in business.


Impairment of cash and cash equivalents and deposits	

For cash and cash equivalents default is considered as soon as balances are not cleared beyond conventional banking settlement timeline, ie., a few days. Therefore, transition is
straight from Stage 1 to Stage 3 given the low number of days that it would take the exposure to reach Stage 3 classification, meaning default. For cash and cash equivalents no Stage 2 is applied given that any past due days would result in default. When calculating the impairment for a bank deposit, any loans or other credit facilities granted by the credit institution to the Group is being set off against the deposits if the bank has a contractual right to offset in case of resolution. Hence, the ECL is recognized on the net amount.

####  Financial liabilities 

Initial recognition and measurement

Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at FVTPL or other financial liabilities that are measured at amortized cost. All financial liabilities are
recognized initially at fair value plus, for an item not at FVTPL, directly attributable transaction costs.

The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables and loans and borrowings, including funding attracted through peer-to-peer platforms as well as subordinated borrowings.

Subsequent measurement
The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below:

Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
A financial liability is classified at FVTPL if it is classified as held for trading, it is a derivative or it is designated as such upon initial recognition. Net gains or losses, including any
interest expense, on liabilities held at FVTPL are recognized in the statement of profit and loss.
The Group has not designated any financial liability as at fair value through profit or loss.

Loans and borrowings
This is the category most relevant to the Group. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the EIR
method. Gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognized; interest expense is recognized through the EIR amortization process. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included
as finance costs in the statement of profit and loss.
This category generally applies to interest-bearing loans and borrowings.


Subordinated borrowings
The Group recognizes liabilities as subordinated borrowings if it is an unsecured loan or bond that ranks below other, more senior loans or securities, and have lower payment priority than more senior debt. Accordingly, the claims of more senior debt holders must be satisfied before the holders of subordinated debt can be paid. In the case of default,
creditors who own subordinated debt will not be paid out until after more senior creditors are paid in full. 
Borrowings are calssified as subordinated only if respective agreements contain dedicated clauses defining the borrowing as subordinated.


Modification of financial liabilities

For financial liabilities, the Group considers a modification substantial based on qualitative factors and if it results in a difference between the adjusted discounted present value
and the original carrying amount of the financial liability of, or greater than, ten percent. If the modification is substantial, then a derecognition gain or loss is recorded on derecognition. If the modification does not result in cash flows that are substantially different the modification does not result in derecognition. Based on the change in cash
flows discounted at the original EIR, the Group records a modification gain or loss.

Treatment of non-substantial modifications

If expectations of fixed rate financial liabilities’ cash flows are revised, then changes to future contractual cash flows are discounted at the original EIR with a consequential adjustment to the carrying amount. The difference from the previous carrying amount is booked as a positive or negative adjustment to the carrying amount of the financial liability on the consolidated statement of financial position with a corresponding increase or decrease in Interest revenue/expense calculated using the effective interest method.


The carrying amount of the financial liability is adjusted if the Group revises its estimates of payments or receipts. If modification of a financial liability measured at amortized
cost does not result in the derecognition a modification gain/loss is calculated. The adjusted carrying amount is calculated based on the original effective interest rate and the
change in carrying amount is recorded as interest income or expense (Note 5).


Changes in the contractual cash flows of the asset are recognized in statement of profit and loss and any costs or fees incurred adjust the carrying amount of the modified
financial asset or liability and are amortized over the remaining term of the modified instrument. Therefore, the original EIR determined at initial recognition is revised on
modification to reflect any costs or fees incurred.


Derecognition

A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the
same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of
the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the statement of profit and loss.

The Group considers a modification substantial based on qualitative factors and if it results in a difference between the adjusted discounted present value and the original carrying amount of the financial liability of, or greater than, ten percent.


####  Equity - accounted investees


The Group interests in equity-accounted investees comprise investment in associate. Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or
joint control, over the financial and operating policies. Interests in associates are accounted for using the equity method. They are initially recognized as cost, which includes
transaction costs. As the Group gained significant influence over its associate after losing control over the investee, the deemed cost is the fair value of the interest retained subsequent to the loss of control. Subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated financial statements include the Group's share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive
income of the associate, until the date on which significant influence ceases. Unrealised gain arising from transactions with associate are eliminated against the investments to
the extent of the Group's interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.

####  Group as a Lessor - Finance lease

Whilst financial lease receivables that represent financial instruments and to which IFRS 16 applies are within the scope of IAS 32 and IFRS 7, they are only within the scope of
IFRS 9 to the extent that they are (1) subject to the derecognition provisions, (2) ‘expected credit loss’ requirements, (3) the relevant provisions that apply to derivatives embedded within leases, and (4) relate to sale and leaseback transactions as outlined in this note under the title Sale and Leaseback Transactions.


Group is engaged in financial lease transactions by selling vehicles to its customers through financial lease contracts. The Group earns its profits predominantly from finance income over the lease term and not from initial selling profit.

At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. The inception of the lease is the earlier of the date of the lease agreement and the
date of commitment by the parties to the principal provisions of the lease. As of this date:

- a lease is classified as a finance lease; and
- the amounts to be recognized at the commencement of the lease term are determined.

The commencement of the lease is the date from which the lessee is entitled to exercise its right to use the leased asset. It is the date of initial recognition of the lease (i.e. the
recognition of the assets, liabilities, income or expenses resulting from the lease, as appropriate).


A lease is classified as a finance lease at the inception of the lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership. The inception of the lease is the
earlier of the date of the lease agreement and the date of commitment by the parties to the principal provisions of the lease. As of this date:

- the lease transfers ownership of the asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term;
- the lessee has the option to purchase the asset at a price which is expected to be sufficiently lower than fair value at the date the option becomes exercisable that, at the
inception of the lease, it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised;
- the lease term is for the major part of the economic life of the asset, even if title is not transferred;
- at the inception of the lease, the present value of the minimum lease payments amounts to at least substantially all of the fair value of the leased asset.


Further indicators that individually or in combination would also lead to a lease being classified as a finance lease are:

- the lessee can cancel the lease, the lessor’s losses associated with the cancellation are borne by the lessee;
- gains or losses from the fluctuation in the fair value of the residual accrue to the lessee.

Initial measurement

At lease commencement, the Group accounts for a finance lease, as follows:
- derecognizes the carrying amount of the underlying asset; and
- recognizes the net investment in the lease.

Upon commencement of finance lease, the Group records the net investment in leases, which consists of the sum of the minimum lease payments receivable by a lessor under a
finance lease, discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease. The contracts with the customers stipulate that the title to the lease object passes to the lessee at the end of the lease term; hence, no unguaranteed residual value accrues to the lessor. The difference between the gross investment and the net investment is recorded as unearned finance lease income. Initial direct costs, such as client commissions and commissions paid by the Group to car dealers, are included in the initial measurement of the lease
receivables.

Based on contractual provisions, prepayments and other payments received from customers are normally recorded in statement of financial position upon receipt and settled
against respective client’s finance lease receivables agreement at the moment of issuing next monthly invoice according to the agreement schedule.

Subsequent measurement

Finance lease income consists of the amortization of unearned finance lease income. Finance lease income is recognized based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment according to effective interest rate in respect of the finance lease. Group applies the lease payments relating to the period against the gross investment in the lease to reduce both the principal and the unearned finance income.

The Group recognizes income from variable payments that are not included in the net investment in the lease (e.g. performance based variable payments, such as penalties or
debt collection income) separately in the period in which the income is earned. The lease term does not reflect the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease due to high termination fees and resulting low probability of option exercise. Such income is recognized under “Fee and commission income” (Note 6).

After lease commencement, the net investment in a lease is not remeasured unless the lease is modified and the modified lease is not accounted for as a separate contract or the lease term is revised when there is a change in the non-cancellable period of the lease. 

Group applies derecognition and impairment requirements in IFRS 9 to the net investment in the lease.

####  Group as a Lessor - Operating lease

Leases in which the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset are classified as operating leases. Rental income arising is accounted
for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and is included in revenue in the statement of profit and loss. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognized over the lease term on the same basis as rental income. Contingent rents are recognized as
revenue in the period in which they are earned. No maintenance fee is charged to the customers.

### 2. Material accounting policy information (continued)

### Group as a Lessee

#### Lease liability

**Initial recognition**

At the commencement date of the lease the Group measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date in accordance with lease
term. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise:
- fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable;
- variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date;
- amounts expected to be payable by the Group under residual value guarantees;
- the exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and
- payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising an option to terminate the lease.


The Group has elected for all classes of underlying assets not to separate non-lease components from lease components in lease payments. Instead Group accounts for each lease component and any associated non-lease components as a single lease component. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that
rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate. 

Lease term is the non-cancellable period for which the Group has the right to use an underlying asset, together with both:
(a) Periods covered by an option to extend the lease if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and
(b) Periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the Group is reasonably certain not to exercise that option.

At the commencement date, the Group assesses whether it is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend the lease or to purchase the underlying asset, or not to exercise
an option to terminate the lease.

Subsequent measurement

After the commencement date, the Group measures the lease liability by:
- increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability;
- reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made; and
- remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications specified, or to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments.


#### Right-of-use assets

**Initial recognition**

At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognizes right-of-use asset at cost. The cost of a right-of-use asset comprises:

- the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability;
- any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received;
- any initial direct costs incurred by the Group; and
- an estimate of costs to be incurred by the Group in dismantling and removing the underlying asset, restoring the site on which it is located or restoring the underlying asset to
the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease, unless those costs are to produce inventories.

Subsequent measurement

Group measures the right-of-use asset at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses; and adjusted for the remeasurement of the lease liability (which may take place when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, when there is change in estimated amounts payable under residual value guarantee or there is a change of assessment of extension, purchase or termination option). Depreciation of the right-of-use asset is recognized on a straight-line basis in profit or loss. If the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the Group by the end of the lease term or if the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group will exercise a purchase option, the Group depreciates the right-of-use asset from the commencement date to the end of the useful life of the underlying asset. Otherwise, the right-of-use asset is depreciated from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term.


Group involvement with the underlying asset before the commencement date

If a Group incurs costs relating to the construction or design of an underlying asset, the lessee accounts for those costs applying other IFRS, such as IAS 16. Costs relating to the
construction or design of an underlying asset do not include payments made by the lessee for the right to use the underlying asset.

Group applies IAS 36 to determine whether the right-of-use asset is impaired and to account for any impairment loss identified.


86

#### pg:86


### 2. Material accounting policy information (continued)

Initial recognition exemptions applied

As a recognition exemption the Group elects not to apply the recognition requirements of right-of-use asset and lease liability to:
(a) Short term leases – for all classes of underlying assets; and
(b) Leases of low-value assets – on a lease-by-lease basis.

For leases qualifying as short-term leases and/or leases of low-value assets, the Group does not recognize a lease liability or right-of-use asset. The Group recognizes the lease
payments associated with those leases as an expense on either a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
(a) Short term leases
A short-term lease is a lease that, at the commencement date, has a lease term of 3 months or less. A lease that contains a purchase option is not a short-term lease. This lease
exemption is applied for all classes of underlying assets.
(b) Leases of low-value assets

The Group defines a low-value asset as one that:
1) has a value, when new of 5 000 EUR or less. Group assesses the value of an underlying asset based on the value of the asset when it is new, regardless of the age of the
asset being leased.
2) the Group can benefit from use of the assets on its own, or together with, other resources that are readily available to the Group; and
3) the underlying asset is not dependent on, or highly interrelated with, other assets.

#### Sale and leaseback transactions

Group also engages in financing of vehicles already owned by the customers. Under such leaseback transactions the Group purchases the underlying asset and then leases it
back to the same customer. Vehicle serves as a collateral to secure all leases. The Group applies the requirements for determining when a performance obligation is satisfied in
IFRS 15 to determine whether the transfer of an asset is accounted for as a sale of that asset. If the transfer of an asset by the seller-lessee does not satisfy the requirements of
IFRS 15 to be accounted for as a sale of the asset, the buyer-lessor shall not recognise the transferred asset and shall recognise a financial asset equal to the transfer proceeds.
It shall account for the financial asset as loans and advances to customers by applying IFRS 9.

The Group has performed SPPI test for its sale and leaseback arrangements. Vehicle serves as a collateral to secure all of such loans. Sale and leaseback contracts include
contractual terms that can vary the contractual cash flows in a way that is unrelated to a basic lending arrangement. Such cash flows arise in the case or borrowers' default and
are related to repossessed car sales for which any excess gains can be retained by the Group in certain jurisdictions and commissions and other fees charged to the customer
that are not directly linked to outstanding principal/interest (e.g. external debt recovery costs being charged to clients with mark-up). Other contract elements relevant to SPPI
assessment for components in certain jurisdictions include the leased asset repurchase options, where the option value is below the car market value at the moment of exercise
and significant termination penalties for certain non-recourse contracts.


The Group has made relevant judgements and concluded that SPPI test is met in all above circumstances as 1) repossession commissions and fees charged by the Group are intended to cover the costs incurred by the Group in the debt servicing process under regular lending model, 2) the fact that in certain jurisdictions the Group maintains proceeds
from sale of repossessed car in excess of recovered exposure (if applicable) is not an evidence that the risk taken up by the Group is in fact the price risk of the car and not the credit risk. The Group is able to sell the collateral and keep any surplus only on default and the occasional trivial gains from the transaction are not the purpose of the core business model (which is to earn interest income from the loan asset) and are not the focus of the business, but instead are just an instrument to minimise the credit losses, 3) termination penalties for non-recourse sale and leaseback transactions charged to the customers in certain jurisdictions are also contractual elements intended to compensate for credit risk and do not result in any notable net gains to the Group.


#### Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value.

Net realizable value represents the estimated selling price for inventories in the ordinary course of business less estimated costs necessary to make the sale. 

Inventories contain only vehicles which are purchased for the sole purpose of selling them to customers.

Value of inventories is measured by using specific identification of individual unit cost. Disposal of each individual stock item is performed on sale of respective individual stock item.

#### Accrued revenue or expenses from currency trading

The Group recognizes accrued income or expenses from transactions of trading currency based on currency rates agreed for each currency hedging transaction. The difference
between hedging rate and currency rate at year end is recognized as accrued income or expenses depending from mathematical result.


 87

#### pg:87

### 2. Material accounting policy information (continued)

#### Assets held for sale 

The Group classifies non-current assets and disposal groups as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through
continuing use. 

Assets held for sale includes vehicles which are obtained by enforcement of repossession in case clients default on existing lease agreements. Such repossessed collaterals are
classified as held for sale and measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell (FVLCTS). Costs to sell are the incremental costs directly
attributable to the disposal of an asset, excluding finance costs and income tax expense. Once classified as held-for-sale, vehicles are no longer depreciated.

The criteria for held for sale classification is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Actions
required to complete the sale should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the sale will be made or that the decision to sell will be withdrawn. Management must
be committed to the plan to sell the asset and the sale expected to be completed within one year from the date of the classification.

Assets classified as held for sale are presented separately as current items in the statement of financial position.

#### Share premium

Share premium represents the amount subscribed for share capital in excess of nominal value.

#### Reserves

Luxembourg companies are required to allocate to a legal reserve a minimum of 5% of its annual net profit until this reserve equals 10% of the subscribed share capital. This
reserve may not be distributed.

Lithuania companies are required to allocate to a legal reserve a minimum of 10% of its annual net profit until this reserve equals 10% of the subscribed share capital. This
reserve may not be distributed.

Moldavian companies are required to allocate to a reserve capital amount in proportion of at least 5% of its annual net profit, until reserve capital equals 10% the amount of the
share capital. The reserve capital of the company may be used only to cover losses or to increase its share capital.

Macedonian companies are required to allocate to a reserve capital amount in proportion of at least 5% of its annual net profit, until reserve capital equals 10% the amount of
the share capital. The reserve capital of the company may be used only to cover losses or to increase its share capital. Reserve may be increased above 5% in order to meet
capital adequacy ratio.

Romanian companies are required to allocate to a reserve capital amount in proportion of at least 5% of its annual net profit, until reserve capital equals 20% the amount of the
share capital. The reserve capital of the company may be used only to cover losses or to increase its share capital.

Foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of assets and liabilities of foreign operations.


#### Transactions with peer-to-peer platforms

Background

Certain subsidiaries, as loan originators, have signed cooperation agreements with operator of a peer-to-peer (P2P) investment internet-based platform. Cooperation agreements
and the related assignment agreements are in force until parties agree to terminate. Purpose of the cooperation agreement for the Group is to attract funding through the P2P
platform.

The P2P platform makes it possible for individual and corporate investors to obtain a fully proportionate interest cash flows and the principal cash flows from debt instruments (finance lease receivables or loans and advances to customers) issued by the Group in exchange for an upfront payment. These rights are established through assignment
agreements between investors and P2P platform, who is acting as an agent on behalf of the Group. Assignment agreements are of two types:

1) Agreements with recourse rights which require the Group to guarantee full repayment of invested funds by the investor in case of default of Group’s customer (buy back
guarantee);
2) Agreements without recourse rights which do not require the Group to guarantee repayment of invested funds by the investor in case of default of the customer (no buy back
guarantee).

The Group retains the legal title to its debt instruments (including payment collection), but transfers a part of equitable title and interest to investors through P2P platform.

Receivables and payables from/to P2P platform

The P2P platform is acting as an agent in transferring cash flows between the Group and investors. The receivable for attracted funding from investors through the P2P platform
corresponds to the due payments from the P2P platform.

Receivable is arising from assignments made through P2P platform where the related investment is not yet transferred to the Group (Note 32).

P2P platform commissions and service fees incurred by the Group are fees charged by P2P platform for servicing the funding attracted through peer-to-peer platform and are
disclosed in Note 9.

88

#### pg:88


### 2. Material accounting policy information (continued)

 Funding attracted through peer-to-peer platform

Liabilities arising from assignments with or without recourse rights are initially recognized at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received from investors net of issue
costs associated with the loan.

Liabilities to investors are recognized in statement of financial position caption Funding attracted through peer-to-peer platform (Note 38) and are treated as loans received.

After initial recognition the funding attracted through peer-to-peer platform is subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Amortized cost
is calculated by taking into account any issue costs, and any discount or premium on settlement. Gains and losses are recognized in the statement of profit and loss as interest
income/ expense when the liabilities are derecognized.

The Group must repay to the investor the proportionate share of the attracted funding for each debt instrument according to the conditions of the respective individual
agreement with the Group’s client, which can be up to 72 months.

Assignments with recourse rights (buy back guarantee)

Assignments with recourse rights provide for direct recourse to the Group, thus do not meet the requirements to be classified as pass-through arrangement in accordance with
IFRS 9. Specifically, neither investors, nor the P2P platform bear any risks in relation to creditworthiness of the Group's borrower. The Group is obliged, on first demand of the P2P platform, to repay all monies due if loan agreement with borrower defaults . Additionally, the Group retains the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset.

Therefore, the Group’s respective debt instruments do not qualify to be considered for partial derecognition and interest expense paid to investors is shown in gross amount
under Interest expense calculated using effective interest method (Note 5).

Assignments without recourse rights (no buy back guarantee)

On the contrary, assignments without recourse rights (the Group is not obliged to reimburse neither to investors nor to P2P platform if the borrower defaults) are arrangements
that transfer to investors substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership equal to a fully proportionate share of the cash flows to be received from Group’s debt instruments.
Therefore such arrangements are classified as pass-through arrangements in accordance with IFRS 9.

As such, a fully proportionate share, equal to investor’s claim in relation to the related debt instrument, is derecognized.


The derecognized part is accounted as an off-balance sheet item (Note 38) and interest income is recognized to the extent of being the residual interest. Residual interest is the
difference between the interest earned on the respective debt instrument by the Group and the respective share of interest earned by the investor.


#### Provisions

In accordance with IAS 37, provisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Where the Group expects some or all of provisions to be reimbursed, for example, under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognized as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to any provision is presented in the statement of profit and loss net of any reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as finance cost.

The key provisions the Group recognizes are provisions for tax positions disputed with tax authorities.

#### Contingent assets and contingent liabilities

Contingent liabilities are not recognized in the financial statements. They are disclosed unless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote. A contingent asset is not recognized in the financial statements but disclosed when an inflow of economic benefits is probable.

#### Share-based payments

The Group may grant share options of Subsidiaries to its employees. Share options are generally awarded on the first day of employment. A share-based payment is primarily a
payment in equity instruments of the entity. Under certain circumstances there are cash settlement alternatives which are subject to cash settlement events occurring or entity’s choice in certain scenarios. Given absence of an ongoing sale of subsidiaries or Eleving Group S.A., any listing process initiated and any other relevant cash settlement events, the cash settlement is considered not to be probable. The Group does not have a present obligation to settle in cash, therefore awards are classified as equity settled. The Group does not have a past practice of cash settlement for these awards.

 Equity-settled transactions

The cost of equity-settled transactions is determined by the fair value at the date when the grant is made using an appropriate valuation model. That cost is recognized in
employee benefits expense, together with a corresponding increase in equity (other capital reserves), over the period in which the service and, where applicable, the performance conditions are fulfilled (the vesting period). The cumulative expense recognized for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The expense or credit in the statement of profit and loss for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognized as at the beginning and end of that period.

89

#### pg:89


### 2. Material accounting policy information (continued)

No expense is recognized for awards that do not ultimately vest because non-market performance and/or service conditions have not been met. Where awards include a market
or non-vesting condition, the transactions are treated as vested irrespective of whether the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance
and/or service conditions are satisfied.

When the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, the minimum expense recognized is the grant date fair value of the unmodified award, provided the original terms of the award are met. An additional expense, measured as at the date of modification, is recognized for any modification that increases the total fair value of the share-based payment transaction, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee. Where an award is cancelled by the entity or by the counterparty, any remaining element of the fair value of the award is expensed immediately through profit or loss.


#### Income and expenses

Expenses are recognized as incurred. Expenses are recognized net of the amount of value added tax. In certain situations value added tax incurred on a services received or
calculated in accordance with legislation requirements is not recoverable in full from the taxation authority. In such cases value added tax is recognized as part of the related expense item as applicable. The same principles is applied if value added tax is not recoverable on acquisition an asset.

Revenue is recognized in accordance with the related standard’s requirements and to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the
revenue can be reliably measured.

 The effective interest rate method

For all financial instruments measured at amortized cost interest income or expense is recorded at the effective interest rate, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability.

The calculation takes into account all contractual terms of the financial instrument and includes any fees or incremental costs that are directly attributable to the instrument and
are an integral part of the effective interest rate, but not future credit losses.

When a financial asset becomes credit-impaired and is regarded as ‘Stage 3’, the Group calculates interest income by applying the EIR to the net amortized cost of the financial
asset. If the financial asset cures and is no longer credit-impaired, the Group reverts to calculating interest income on a gross basis.


 Income from cession of bad debt

Gain or loss from sale of doubtful financial lease receivables and loans and advances to customers is presented on net basis under ” Net loss from de-recognition of financial assets measured at amortized cost”. Gains or losses arising on cession deals are recognized in the statement of profit and loss at transaction date as the difference between the proceeds received and the carrying amount of derecognized lease receivables assigned through cession agreements.


 Expenses related to attracting funding

Expenses related to attracting funding consists of administration fee for using peer-to-peer platform. Expenses are charged monthly and recognized in Group's statement of profit and loss when they occur.



#### Revenues and expenses from contracts with customers


Revenue from contracts with customers in scope of IFRS 15 encompasses sold goods or services provided as output of the Group’s ordinary activities. The Group uses the
following criteria to identify contracts with customers:
– the parties in the contract have approved the contract (in writing, orally or in accordance with other customary business practices) and are committed to perform their
respective obligations;
– can be identified each party’s rights regarding the goods or services to be transferred;
– can be identified the payment terms for the goods or services to be transferred;
– the contract has commercial substance (i.e. the risk, timing or amount of the entity’s future cash flows is expected to change as a result of the contract);
– it is probable that the Group will collect the consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer.

Performance obligations are promises in the contracts (either explicitly stated or implied) with Group’s customers to transfer to the customers distinct goods or services.
Promised goods or services represent separate performance obligations if the goods or services are distinct. A promised good or service is considered distinct if the customer can
benefit from the good or service on its own or with other readily available resources (i.e. distinct individually) and the good or service is separately identifiable from other
promises in the contract (distinct within the context of the contract). Both of these criteria must be met to conclude that the good or service is distinct.

The Group considers whether there are other promises in the contract that are separate performance obligations to which a portion of the transaction price needs to be allocated. In determining the transaction price for the sale of equipment, the Group considers the effects of variable consideration, the existence of significant financing components, noncash consideration, and consideration payable to the customer (if any). 

The Group recognizes revenue when (or as) it satisfies a performance obligation to transfer a promised good or service to a customer. Revenue is recognized when customer
obtains control of the respective good or service. Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized when control of the goods or services are transferred to the customer at
an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.



90

#### pg:90


### 2. Material accounting policy information (continued)

Revenue from satisfied performance obligations is recognized over time, if one of the following criteria is met:
– customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits;
– customer controls the asset as it is created or enhanced;
– the Group’s performance creates an asset and has a right to payment for performance completed.


Payment terms for goods or services transferred to customers according to contract terms are within 45 to 60  days from the provision of services or sale of goods. The transaction price is generally determined by the contractually agreed conditions. Invoices typically are issued after the goods have been sold or service provided.


Key revenue streams the Group generates relate to provision of goods or services provided directly to end customer with no third party service/product provider involved. In such transaactions the Group acts as a principal. However, for certain services, where other parties are involved, as described below, the Group performs assessment whether it acts as an agent or a principal. Such revenue streams include income from debt collection activities, income from providing registration services and income from agency services as described below.


When another party is involved in providing goods or services to the Group's customers, the Group considers that it is a principal, if it obtains control of any one of the following:

a) a good or another asset from the other party that it then transfers to the customer;									
b) a right to a service to be performed by the other party, which gives the entity the ability to direct that party to provide the service to the customer on the entity's behalf - relevant for car registration income to conclude on principal presentation;	c) a good or service from the other party that it then combines with other goods or services in providing the specified good or service to the customer - relevant for debt collection income to conclude on agent presentation.


#### Fee and commission income (Note 6)

 Income from debt collection activities and earned penalties (point in time)

Fee and commission income arises from contracts with customers. Accordingly, it results in a recognized financial instrument in the Group's financial statements that is partially
in scope of IFRS 9 and partially in scope of IFRS 15. Therefore, the Group first applies IFRS 9 to separate and measure the part of the contract that is in the scope of IFRS 9 and
then applies IFRS 15 to the residual.

Income from debt collection activities and penalties is recognized in Group's statement of profit and loss at the moment when the likelihood of consideration being settled for such services is high, therefore income is recognized only when actual payment for provided services is actually received. 

Income from penalties arise in case customers breach the contractual terms of financial lease receivables and loans and advances to customers agreements, such as exceeding the payment date. In those situations Group is entitled to charge the customers in accordance with the agreement terms. 

The Group recognizes income from penalties at the moment of cash receipt as likelihood and timing of settlement is uncertain. In case customers do not settle the penalty amount, the Group is entitled to enforce repossession of the collateral.

Debt collection activities revenue typically arises when customers delay the payments due. As a lessor, the Group has protective rights in the lease agreements with customers that require the customers to safeguard and maintain the condition of the vehicle, as it serves as a collateral to the lease. Group’s revenue encompasses a compensation of internal and external costs incurred by the Group in relation to debt management, legal fees as well as repossession of vehicle in case of lease agreement termination and are recharged to the customers in accordance with the agreement terms.  The performance obligation is satisfied when respective service has been provided.

Income from commissions (point in time)

Income from commissions arises from additional services provided by the Group to its customers. Main additional source of income from commissions is from premature termination of contracts by the initiative from a customer. Income is recognized at the moment of cash receipt as likelihood and timing of settlement is uncertain. The performance obligation is satisfied when respective service has been provided.

Income from providing registration services (point in time)

In certain countries, the Group provides vehicle registration services to its customers. The Group organizes the registration of the leased vehicles in with the state authorities on behalf of the customer, which is a separate service provided by the Group. Typically these services are performed before customers enter the finance lease agreements. Income from providing these services is recognized at the moment of providing the services. In majority of countries such services are not provided by the Group, as the customers perform registration procedures themselves and costs are covered by the customers directly without the need for such services from the Group. The performance obligation is satisfied when the respective service has been provided.


#### Revenue from car sales and other goods (Note 11)

 Sale of motor vehicles and other goods (point in time)

The Group earns part of its revenues from the sales of used vehicles that were either bought from third parties or repossessed from its non-performing leasing customers . The 
Group is calculating minimum sales price based on initial cost or value after repossession plus additional cost incurred (e.g. repairs) and a margin added in order to make profit from the deal. The performance obligation is satisfied when the car is registered on client’s name. Similarly the Group is selling mobile phones in Africa region.

#### Other operating income (Note 14)

Income from management services (over time)

The Group provides management services to its related parties. Income is recognized at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for providing these services. The performance obligation is satisfied as the respective service is being provided.

Revenue from agency services (point in time)

Agency services consist of different services, such as settlement of costs on behalf of 3rd parties and recharging those costs to customers. The Group is acting as an agent in provision of these services to the customers. Such services are provided with the intention to realize the economies of scale of purchasing power for a service that is both used by the Group and the 3rd party. The Group recognises revenue in the amount of any fee or commission to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for arranging for the specified services to be provided by the other party. The performance obligation is satisfied when the respective service has been provided.

Variable consideration revenue from client acquisition (point in time)

The Group has entered into a contract with JSC Primero Finance on providing commercial client acquisition services with the variable component of the contract on 26 September, 2019.									
									
The fee is paid on all concluded agreements with clients. The fee consists of two elements – fixed and variable. Fixed fee is set as % from total loan amount and is invoiced every month based on concluded agreement list for previous month. Variable fee part is an additional fee and is set as percentage dependant on the specific annual percentage rate (APR) threshold for each individual concluded agreement.																
The fixed and variable part of client acquisition fee is calculated and invoiced monthly. The revenue from the fixed part of the fee is recognized at point in time as the corresponding performance obligations are satisfied, and there is no significant judgement applied to determine the transaction price or the satisfaction of the performance obligations.									
									
The additional client acquisition fee is determined to be a variable consideration as it is based on the individual APR of each concluded agreement.	

In the case of loan defaults, the parties agreed to measure the default loss. In the cases when not all outstanding debt has been covered after the collateral sale, the Group returns part (proportional to the uncovered debt) of the additional fee, which has been invoiced to JSC Primero Finance.	
								
####Contract balances									
									
 Contract assets									
A contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to the customer. If the Group performs by transferring goods or services to a customer before the customer pays consideration or before payment is due, a contract asset is recognized for the earned consideration.									
									
As at 31 December 2023 the Group did not have any contract assets in its consolidated statement of financial position.									
									
Trade receivables									
A receivable represents the Group’s right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional (i.e., only the passage of time is required before payment of the consideration is due).									
									
These receivables are disclosed in balance sheet caption 'Trade receivables' (Note 31).									
Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are generally on terms of 30 to 120 days. Accounting policies applicable to financial assets measured using amortized cost are applicable as described above in Note 2.									
									
									
Contract liabilities									
A contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Group has received consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer. If a customer pays consideration before the Group transfers goods or services to the customer, a contract liability is recognized when the payment is made or the payment is due (whichever is earlier). Contract liabilities are extinguished and revenue is recognized when the Group performs under the contract.									
																
As at 31 December 2023 the Group does not have any contract liabilities in its consolidated statement of financial position.

#### Income taxes									
									
Income taxes include current and deferred taxes. Income taxes are recognized in profit and loss except to the extent that they are related to a business combination, or items recognized directly in equity or other comprehensive income. Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. The amount of current tax payable or receivable is the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received that reflects uncertainty related to income taxes. It is measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date in the countries where the Group and the Parent Company operates. 									
							
Current corporate income tax rate for the Parent company is applied at the statutory rate of 24.94%. Current corporate income tax rates for the foreign subsidiaries are:									

| Country  | Tax rate |
|----------|----------|
| Estonia* | 20%      |
| Latvia*  | 20%      |
| Lithuania| 15%      |
| Georgia* | 15%      |
| Poland   | 19%      |
| Romania  | 16%      |
| Kenya    | 30%      |
| Uganda   | 30%      |
| Botswana | 22%      |
| Zambia   | 30%      |
| Mauritius| 15%      |



| Country             | Tax rate |

| Moldova             | 12%      |
| Albania             | 15%      |
| Belarus             | 20%      |
| Ukraine             | 18%      |
| Uzbekistan          | 7.5%     |
| North Macedonia     | 10%      |
| Bosnia & Herzegovina| 10%      |
| Lesotho             | 25%      |
| Eswatini            | 27.5%    |
| Namibia             | 32%      |


* - as described further below corporate income tax in these countries is paid on distributed profits and deemed profit distributions only.									



#### Deferred tax assets and liabilities									
									
Deferred income tax is recognized on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. However, deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit / loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realized or the deferred income tax liability is settled.									
							
Deferred income tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized.									
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.									
							
In Latvia, Estonia and Georgia deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognized starting from 2017 or before in accordance with local legislation. Accordingly, deferred tax assets and liabilities which were calculated and recognized previously have been reversed through the statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income in the year when the legislation was amended (for Latvia: 2017).

In Latvia legal entities are not  required to pay income tax on earned profits starting from 1 January 2018 in accordance with amendments made to the Corporate Income Tax Law of the Republic of Latvia. Corporate income tax is paid on distributed profits and deemed profit distributions. Consequently, current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rate applicable to undistributed profits. Starting from 1 January 2018, both distributed profits and deemed profit distributions are subject to the tax rate of 20 per cent of their gross amount, or 20/80 of net expense. Corporate income tax on dividends is recognized in the statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income as expense in the reporting period when respective dividends are declared, while, as regards to other deemed profit items, at the time when expense is incurred in the reporting year.								
Similar accounting policies are adopted in Estonia and Georgia.									
									
									
#### Related parties									
									
The parties are considered related when one party has a possibility to control the other one or has significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions. Related parties of the Group are shareholders who could control or who have significant influence over the Group in accepting operating business decisions, key management personnel of the Group including members of Supervisory body – Audit committee and close family members of any above-mentioned persons, as well as entities over which those  persons have a control or significant influence.									

The Group has defined that a person or a close member of that person’s family is related to a reporting entity if that person: 									
- has control or joint control of the reporting entity;				
- has significant influence over the reporting entity; or				
- is a member of the key management personnel of the reporting entity or of a parent of the reporting entity.				

93

#### pg:93 (here 23.07)


### 2. Material accounting policy information (continued)									
									
An entity is related to a reporting entity if any of the following conditions applies:									
- The entity and the reporting entity are members of the same group (which means that each parent, subsidiary and fellow subsidiary is related to the others);									
									
- One entity is an associate or joint venture of the other entity (or an associate or joint venture of a member of a group of which the other entity is a member);									
									
- Both entities are joint ventures of the same third party;									
- One entity is a joint venture of a third entity and the other entity is an associate of the third entity;			

- The entity is a post-employment benefit plan for the benefit of employees of either the reporting entity or an entity related to the reporting entity. If the reporting entity is itself such a plan, the sponsoring employers are also related to the reporting entity;									
									
- The entity is controlled or jointly controlled by a person identified in (a);		

- A person identified in (a)(i) has significant influence over the entity or is a member of the key management personnel of the entity (or of a parent of the entity);									
									
- The entity, or any member of a group of which it is a part, provides key management personnel services to the reporting entity or to the parent of the reporting entity.																	
A related party transaction is a transfer of resources, services or obligations between a reporting entity and a related party, regardless of whether a price is charged.									
																	

#### Non-controlling interest									
									
Non-controlling interest is that part of the net results and of the equity of a subsidiary attributable to interests which are not owned, directly or indirectly, by the Group. Non-controlling interest forms a separate component of the Group’s equity.									
Non-controlling interest are measured initially at their proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets at the date of acquisition.									
									
									
#### Dividend distribution									
									
Dividend distribution to the shareholders of the Group is recognized as a liability and as distribution of retained earnings in the financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the shareholders as the Group has the obligations to pay the dividend which cannot be withdrawn.									
									
									
									
#### Subsequent events									
									
Post-period-end events that provide additional information about the Group’s position at the statement of financial position date (adjusting events) are reflected in the consolidated financial statements. Post-period-end events that are not adjusting events are disclosed in the notes when material.									
									
									
									
### 3. Significant accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions									
									
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, and disclosure of contingencies. The most significant areas of estimation and judgement used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements include assumptions used in Goodwill and other non-financial asset impairment tests, Impairment of financial assets, Determination of fair values and judgements around Going concern and military conflict in Ukraine impact assessment. They are described below among other estimates and judgements used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements. Although these estimates and conclusions are based on the management’s best knowledge of current events and actions, the actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates.									

									
#### Principal versus agent assessment									
									
In provision of agency services (Note 14) the Group has assessed that it does not obtain control of these services before they are transferred to customers, as these services or goods are acquired on their behalf. Therefore, it is considered agent in these transactions.									
									
The Group is also acting as an agent in purchasing specific goods and services from 3rd parties on behalf of customers - mainly legal, recruitment and similar services, as it does not obtain control of the service, does not incur inventory risk nor has discretion in determining the sales price. For all other revenue streams the Group concluded that it acts as a principal.									
									
									
Other revenue streams where the Group involves third parties in the provision of services include income from debt collection activities (Group acts as an agent as it does not control the service before it is provided to the customer) and income from car registration services (Group acts as a principal as it controls the asset being registered for the prospective customer).

#### pg:94

### 3. Significant accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions (continued)									
									
#### Goodwill and other non-financial asset impairment tests 									
									
The calculation of value in use for cash generating units among other is sensitive to the assumptions of discount rate and growth rates. These assumptions and their sensitivity are outlined in Note 21.									
									
									
									
#### Determination of the FVLCTS of assets held for sale									
									
Determination of the FVLCTS for repossessed vehicles is performed on an individual basis at the moment of the repossession.									
Management's estimate is based on available data from historical sales transactions for such assets in previous reporting periods. The Group also considers factors such as historical actual average loss (if any) from the previous years. Management considers whether also events after the reporting year indicate a decline in the sales prices of such assets.							
									
See further information in Note 35.									
									
									
#### Estimation of the residual value of rental fleet 									
									
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that the expected residual value of the rental fleet asset at the end of the current rental period may not be recoverable. The residual value is an estimate of the amount that could be received from disposal of the vehicle at the reporting date if the asset were already of the age and in the condition that it will be in when Group expects to dispose of it (i.e. after expiration of the ultimate lease period, if any). Therefore, if any indication exists, in order to determine the recoverable amount for rental fleet assets, the management uses valuation models based on two methods primarily depending from the status of the lease agreement: 													
1) value in use (VIU) - for assets with active lease agreements; and									
2) fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCOD) - for assets with inactive lease agreements.		

VIU is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or cash generating unit, both from its continuing use and ultimate disposal. In assessing VIU, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using WACC. In measuring VIU the Group bases its cash flow projections on reasonable and supportable assumptions that represent management’s best estimate of the range of economic conditions that will exist over the remaining useful life of the asset covering in total 7-year period.															
									
For assets with an inactive lease agreement the Group applies probability-weighted scenario in determining the possible future use of vehicles - secondary rent or disposal. The outcome of the probability-weighted scenario has been determined based on the Group’s/Company’s historical data. According to management assessment, the carrying amount of secondary rent assets is expected to be recovered principally through a continuing use of it rather than sale transactions, therefore VIU method has been applied.													
For assets with an inactive agreement, for which the carrying amount is expected to be recovered principally through disposal, the Group determines the residual value based on FVLCOD method. Assumptions applied for determination of the FVLCOD of assets are based on making a reliable estimate of the price at which a transaction to sell the asset would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions and on available data from historical sales transactions. The market price is being adjusted for car repair costs, which are estimated based on historical data for an average vehicle repair expenses occurred in 2022. In addition, management considers whether events after the reporting year indicate a decline in the sales prices of such assets. Costs of disposal are incremental costs directly attributable to the disposal of an asset or cash generating unit, excluding finance costs and income tax expense.									
									
									
For assets an assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognized impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the Company estimates the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s recoverable amount. A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognized in the statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income unless the asset is carried at a revaluated amount, in which case the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase.										
									
As at 31 December 2023 the Group recognised impairment of rental fleet. Please refer to Note 22.									
									
									
#### Impairment of financial assets									
									
The measurement of impairment losses under IFRS 9 across all categories of financial assets in scope requires judgement, in particular, the estimation of the amount and timing of future cash flows and collateral values when determining impairment losses and the assessment of a significant increase in credit risk. These estimates are driven by a number of factors, changes in which can result in different levels of allowances. The Group’s ECL calculations are outputs of complex models with a number of underlying assumptions regarding the choice of variable inputs and their interdependencies. Elements of the ECL models that are considered accounting judgements and estimates include Probability of Default and Loss Given Default, judgment is applied also when determining significant increase in credit risk.

### 3. Significant accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions (continued)

#### Impairment of finance lease receivables and loans and advances to customers									
									
 The Probability of Default (PD)

The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon, where default is defined as:
1. 61 DPD (Finance lease receivables and secured loans, matured countries)
2. 35 DPD (Finance lease receivables and secured loans, non-matured countries)
3. 61 DPD Loans and advances to customers (unsecured loans, car loans) 
4. 91 DPD Loans and advances to customers (unsecured loans, acquired businesses). 
In order to estimate PDs the Group utilizes Markov chains methodology. This methodology employs statistical analysis of historical transitions between delinquency buckets to estimate the probability that loan will eventually end up in default state which is set as absorbing state. 
The Group uses 12-months continuous horizon window (or smaller if actual lifetime of the product is shorter), and estimation over lifetime is defined as nth power of 12-months matrix (n – depends on the estimated lifetime, e.g., if lifetime is 36-months then n=3).
Exposures are grouped into buckets of days past due (DPD) loans/leases.									
							
									
Forward-looking macroeconomic indicators model for portfolio		

Guided by IFRS 9, the Group assesses forward looking information and incorporates it into impairment model. Impairment change is modelled given expected future changes of macroeconomic factors’ (hereinafter macro model). In 2021 the Group changed Hierarchical Bayes model approach to simplified approached based on relation analysis between changes in input variables and changes in PD and the Group expert’s opinion. Macro model uses several assumptions which were agreed by group of experts. Model assumptions and historical periods for macroeconomic factors are reviewed and analyzed once per year considering available macroeconomic outlooks.									
								
									
General description of the model		

Macro model uses expected changes in macroeconomic indicators and assumes the same or similar change to Stage 1 PD. Model incorporates three macro indicators - unemployment rate, inflation rate and GDP annual growth rate, as more relevant for private individuals’ financial stability evaluation. The model is based on actual and forecasted data points. Recalculated in December 2023 model includes macroeconomic indicators as of 2023 Q4 and average of all four 2024 quarter forecasts to predict the effect on Stage 1 PD. Data points average is taken to avoid significant indicator fluctuations due to forecast volatility. The Group built macroeconomic models for each country and business (vehicle/consumer) individually – LV, LT, EE, GE, AM, UZ, KE, UG, MD, RO, BY, MK, AL, LES, ZM, NM, BOT. Data for all cases is taken from the source: https://tradingeconomics.com/indicators. Forecasts are validated by National Banks forecasts.	
						
									
For each macro indicator three scenarios are obtained – base, best and worse. Base scenario is based on actual data and forecasts. Worse and best scenario is obtained from base scenario increasing or decreasing base scenario by confidence interval of given macro indicator forecast. For each scenario is applied probability of occurring. The impact on PD from each macro indicator is calculated as weighted output across all three scenarios. As for all input macro indicators are applied weights according to their significance to the default rates of the Group customers then the final model output is obtained as sum of weighted output across all macro indicators.									
						
									
Model’s variables and assumptions									
									
The model includes indicators which, based on the Group experts’ opinion and used practice in industry, might have a significant impact on finance products default rates. Such indicators are also widely used by banking and non-banking industry across the world:									
									
1. GDP growth									
2. unemployment rate (UR) change									
3. inflation rate (IR) change.									
									
There are several assumptions made in the model to accommodate the Group customer specifics.									
									
 Assumption 1. UR is one of the main variables in the model, and it significantly affects Stage 1 PD.	

 Assumption 2. Okun’s law holds in macro environment affected by macro-economic shocks. 	

 Assumption 3. Typically, reasonably increasing inflation rate positively affects consumption and economy in general, and therefore reduces PD. However, the Groups customers rather suffers from increase in prices than benefit from income increase. Thus, the Group arrived at the assumption 3: increase in inflation in will affect customers negatively.											

Determination of impact on PD based on macro indicator change									
									
The model assumes relation between changes in macro indicators and Stage 1 PD change. If there is strong correlation between Stage 1 PD and macro indicator change then used linear regression equation to determine the impact on PD due to macro indicator changes. If there is no visible correlation between Stage 1 PD and macro indicators change then impact on PD is evaluated based on qualitative analysis of available data and reasonable experts’ assumptions:										
									
1. For each macro indicator chosen 25 data points, one 0 point and another 24 points that reflects indicator change – 12 points with negative change and 12 data points with positive change. The distance between 2 adjacent points is the same for all 24 points and is evaluated considering historical changes in macro indicators.									
									
									
2. For PD impact determination relational table is built that describes linear or piecewise smooth function and its direction changes at 0 point. At 0 point assumed 0 PD impact. For other macro indicator change points impact on PD is evaluated individually based on historical PD rates and PD change in time, as well taking into account each country and product specifics. Then evaluated PD impacts on each macro indicator change point are summarized in table. This table remains fixed until the next year when impact on PD will be reviewed.

#### pg:96

### 3. Significant accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions (continued)									
									
Weighted scenarios approach									
									
To take into account possible economic fluctuations and uncertainty, three scenarios are considered and used for final calculation to arrive at weighted average probability:									
									
1. base case scenario - based on actual data and forecasts by external source.									
2. worst case scenario - based on expert judgement of potential worsening of macroeconomic indicators.
3. best case scenario - based on expert judgement of potential improvement of macroeconomic indicators.									
									
Worse and best scenario is obtained from base scenario increasing or decreasing base scenario by confidence interval of given macro indicator forecast. Confidence intervals are available for each macroeconomic indicator forecast.									
									
Each scenario also has a specific probability of occurring, which is configurable for each country separately to account for potential differences in macroeconomic outlooks. 
The Group’s experts analyse Europe and World macroeconomic projections and opinions (for example [1], [2], [3]). The global economy is experiencing several turbulent challenges. Inflation higher than seen in several decades, tightening financial conditions in most regions, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the lingering COVID-19 pandemic all weigh heavily on the outlook. Normalization of monetary and fiscal policies that delivered unprecedented support during the pandemic is cooling demand as policymakers aim to lower inflation back to target. But a growing share of economies are in a growth slowdown or outright contraction. The global economy’s future health rests critically on the successful calibration of monetary policy, the course of the war in Ukraine, and the possibility of further pandemic-related supply-side disruptions. Considering mentioned information, the Group applies at least 15% probability for worst-case scenario and only 5% for best-case. Last updated forecasts for macroeconomic indicators already reflect actual trends, for example – increase in inflation rate. At this stage base-case scenario is considered as a most possible but should be reviewed for Q2. Sensitivity test was done to evaluate impact from scenarios probability change. Changing worst-case scenario probability till 50%, no major effect on macro coefficient noticed. But, considering uncertainty in projections, macro coefficient was increased by 2pp for Eurozone countries.								
								
									
Macro model results									
									
To obtain final effect on PD from macro indicator change, applied weights for each macro indicator and the final result is taken as a weighted average of macro indicator PD effect. Weights are changed based on their significance in affecting default rate overall. Considering model main assumptions, the Group’s experts evaluate historical relationship and chooses weights for each country individually. In most of the countries UR (unemployment rate) and IR (inflation rate) chosen as main macro indicators and higher weights are applied for them.									
									
To account for future uncertainty in case the model yields positive PD correction, the Group decided to be prudent and not to apply improving PD effect for impairment correction.										
									
Illustration of example: UR impact evaluation on PD:									

| Scenarios                   | Current rate | 2Y forecast | Difference (p.p.) | Likelihood of the scenario | Impact on PD |
|-----------------------------|--------------|-------------|-------------------|----------------------------|--------------|
| Worst case scenario         | 7.400%       | 8.50%       | 1.1pp             | 15%                        | 109.6%       |
| Base case scenario          | 7.400%       | 7.40%       | 0pp               | 80%                        | 100.0%       |
| Best case scenario          | 7.400%       | 6.30%       | -1.1pp            | 5%                         | 93.7%        |
| **Final macroeconomic correction** |              |             |                   | **100%**                   | **101.1%**   |


Loss Given Default									
									
Group closely following recoveries from defaulted finance lease receivables and revises LGD rates every month for portfolios based on actual recoveries received.									
									
- The sample used for LGD calculation consists of all the finance lease receivables that have been defaulted historically. If termination of the contract happens before default state is reached, then loan is considered defaulted (early default) and it is considered in LGD sample. Subsequent recoveries on such loans are monitored on a monthly basis. Recoveries from regular collections process, car sales, cessions and legal process are followed.									
									
									
- Renewed leases (restored payments capacity after termination) also affect the LGD rate by incorporating recovered cash after renewal of the agreement and comparing it to the exposure at default of the agreements subsequently renewed, implying the cure rate. Cure rate from renewals is calculated over a three-year period. For the 31 December 2023 impairment purposes recovery rate for renewed cases were applied in range of 76% to 98% depending on the market. Above described LGD rate is used for all portfolio groups except for unsecured portfolio part. For unsecured portfolio part LGD is estimated using triangular recovery matrix on all unsecured cases. Received recovery is discounted with effective interest rate depending on the number of months between the date account got unsecured status and the date when recovery was received. Given that majority of the car sales happen before unsecured status, the LGD for unsecured portfolio is higher than for other buckets – as of 31 December 2023 Group average LGD unsecured for portfolios with DPD less than 360 DPD was 66%, respective LGD for portfolio older than 360 DPD was 94%.									
								
									
Loans and advances to customers (unsecured loans, car loans)

For unsecured loans LGD is determined based on debt sales market activity and offered prices or based on historical recoveries. For the later stages (DPD 360) LGD is set to 100%.									
Loans and advances to customers (unsecured loan, businesses acquired in 2020 and 2023)	

LGD is calculated using triangle recovery matrix built on all defaulted loans. Received recovery is discounted with effective interest rate depending on the number of months between the date account got into default and the date when recovery was received. For later stages (DPD 360) LGD is set to 100%.

### 3. Significant accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions (continued)									
										
Exposure at default (EAD ) modelling									
										
Exposure at default is modelled by adjusting the unpaid balance of lease and loan receivables as at the reporting date by expected future repayments during the next 12 months. As of 31 December 2023, it is applied for Stage 1 exposures only. This is performed based on contractual repayment schedules, adjusted for historical prepayment rate observed.													
Historical prepayment patterns are assumed to be a reliable estimate for future prepayment activity.									
										
Loans and advances to customers (unsecured loan, businesses acquired in 2020 and 2023) 

EAD is calculated using the sample of defaulted loans. Outstanding balance of defaulted loans is divided by outstanding balance of the same accounts 12 months ago. Observation window can be shortened; however, it cannot exceed 12 months to avoid overestimation of EAD which may lead to underestimation of ECL. As of 31 December 2023, EAD is applied for Stage 1 and Stage 2.								
										
Impairment for loans to and receivables from related parties									
Receivables from related parties inherently are subject to the Group’s credit risk. Therefore, a benchmarked PD and LGD rate - based on Standard & Poor's corporate statistics studies has been applied in determining the ECLs.									
										
Significant increase in credit risk for related party transactions is determined based on information available in the Group about the financial performance of the related parties. Financial position of related parties as at impairment assessment date is compared to that when the exposure was originated. Further 30 days past due back stop indicator is utilized to transfer exposures to Stage 2.									
								
										
#### Recoverability of deferred tax asset									
										
Deferred tax assets are recognized for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the losses can be utilized. Significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognized, based upon the likely timing and level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies. The deferred tax assets are recognized based on profitability assumptions over 3 year horizon. In developing these assumptions the Group considers both positive and negative evidence of past performance and future development plans to ensure that assumptions used are reasonable, realistic and achievable. The future taxable profit of 2024-2025 has been approved by the Management Board, while 2026 is considered as plausible taxable profit of the Group. Budgeting models used are the same as the ones used in goodwill impairment tests.																							
At each reporting date, the Group’s management analyses the recoverability of deferred tax and reduces the deferred tax asset if it is no longer probable that during the period of utilization of tax losses future taxable profits will be available against which unused tax losses can be utilized (Note 18).											
#### Capitalization of development costs									
										
For capitalization of expenses in process of developing Group's enterprise resource planning (ERP) system and other IT systems management uses certain assumptions. Capitalization of salary expenses of IT personnel is based on employee time sheets and personnel involved in development dedicate up to 80% of their time on developing new functionality. Therefore up to 80% of salary expenses of involved personnel are capitalized under Other intangible assets while remaining 20% are recognized as salary expenses in Statement of profit and loss.									
										
Expenses from amortization of capitalized development costs are included in statement of profit and loss caption "Administrative expense". 
See further information in Note 21.									
										
									
#### Separation of embedded derivatives from the host contract									
										
The Group has certain call and put option arrangements that can accelerate repayment of the issued bonds. These options arise out of bond (host contract) prospectus and meet the definition of an embedded derivative in accordance with IFRS 9.									
										
Call option, which is  included in Latvian bond prospectus, gives the Group the right, but not the obligation to carry out early redemption, either in full or partially, of the issued bonds with a 1% premium. There is also a put option possibility in case (i) certain financial covenants are breached (ii) Interest and/or Nominal Amount payments have not been missed and (iii) the Issuer has been declared insolvent or has submitted an application for liquidation, then each bondholder has the right to request that all, or only some, of its Latvian bonds are repurchased at the nominal amount plus accrued unpaid interests and Default Interest.									
																			
There are also call and put options included in Eurobond prospectus. The Group may redeem all of the outstanding Eurobonds in full prior to the their maturity date, at the make whole amount if the call is exercised before 18 October 2023; 104.75 percent of the nominal amount if such redemption right is exercised after the first call date up to 18 October 2024; at 102.375 percent of the nominal amount if is exercised after the second call date up to up to 18 October 2025; and 100% of the Nominal Amount if the call option is exercised after 18 October 2025. There is also a put option possibility in case of change of control event, breach of certain financial covenants, ultimate beneficial owner of the Group being included into a sanction list of the European Union and the USE, then each bondholder has the right to request that all, or only some, of its Eurobonds are repurchased at a price of 101.00 percent of the nominal amount plus accrued unpaid interests.									
										
The Group’s management has evaluated that the embedded derivatives are not contractually separable, not contractually transferrable independently and have the same counterparty. Each option’s exercise price is approximately equal on each exercise date to the amortized cost of bond, therefore these embedded derivatives are not separated from the host contract.

### 3. Significant accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions (continued)									
									
#### Fair value of employee share options									
									
The Group’s employees have entered a share option agreement with the Parent Company or the Parent Company’s shareholders and Subsidiaries. Under the agreements respective employees obtain rights to acquire Parent company’s or certain subsidiaries’ shares under several graded vesting scenarios. The respective option would be classified as an equity-settled share-based payment transaction in Group’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS 2. There are cash settlement alternatives. Given absence of an ongoing sale of any of Subsidiaries or the Parent or any listing process initiated and other relevant cash settlement events, then cash settlement is considered not to be probable and the Group does not have a present obligation to settle in cash. 									
								
The Group’s management has estimated that fair value of the options would not be materially different than zero. If it were, the Group would have to record expenses related to this transaction and recognize a respective component of equity.									
In estimating fair value for the share option the most appropriate valuation model would depend on the terms and conditions of the grant. In 2019 fair value of employee share options has been estimated by first establishing the fair value at the grant date of the relevant issuer company/group applying discounted cash flow valuation methodology and same assumptions as the ones used in value in use estimation (refer to Goodwill impairment tests). Subsequently, the estimate is adjusted by the number of options granted, vesting period and the employee turnover rates in the respective grade.									
																		
Management has considered that the financial position of the Subsidiaries that have issued share options (in particular for General Employee Share Option Plan described in Note 48), the particular features mentioned in the option agreements, such as buy-back options, non-competition clauses embedded in the agreements, restrictions of sales of shares, as well as dividend policy of the Parent Company (for both of the plans described in Note 48) effectively indicate that fair value of the employee options would not be material.									
									
									
#### Deferred Tax Liability on unremitted earnings									
									
In Latvia, Estonia and Georgia legal entities are required to pay income tax on earned profits in accordance with local legislation on Corporate Income Tax. Corporate income tax would be paid on distributed profits and deemed profit distributions. Corporate income tax on dividends would be recognized in the statement of profit and loss as expense in the reporting period when respective dividends are declared, while, as regards other deemed profit items, at the time when expense is incurred in the reporting year.									
									
The Group has decided to use these beneficial tax regimes to reinvest profits in further development of respective subsidiaries, therefore it does not plan to distribute dividends from subsidiaries in these countries in the next 5 years. The Group controls the process of dividend distribution and does not plan to distribute dividends from subsidiaries of these countries for year 2023 and after in the foreseeable future: 5 year horizon is considered appropriate given the Group's planning cycle.									
																		
Due to above mentioned reason, the Group has not recognized deferred tax liabilities.									
See further information in Note 17.									
									
									
#### Provisions									
									
Significant management judgement is used for estimating provisions in relation to tax amounts disputed with tax authorities.
For more details see Note 37.								
									
									
#### Lease term determination under IFRS 16 (Group as a Lessee)									
									
IFRS 16 requires that in determining the lease term and assessing the length of the non-cancellable period of a lease, an entity shall determine the period for which the contract is enforceable. In assessment of lease term determination the Group considers the enforceable rights and obligations of both parties. If both the lessee and the lessor can terminate the contract without more than an insignificant penalty at any time at or after the end of the non-cancellable term, then there are no enforceable rights and obligations beyond the non-cancellable term. For lease agreements without a fixed term and agreements that are “rolled over” on monthly basis until either party gives notice the Group considers that it does have enforceable rights and obligations under such agreements, therefore a reasonable estimate of the lease term assessment is made.									
																	
When determining the lease term, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive for the lessee to exercise an option to renew or not to exercise an option to terminate early. When assessing whether the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend, or not to exercise an option to terminate early, the economic reasons underlying the Group's past practice regarding the period over which it has typically used particular types of assets (whether leased or owned) are considered. Furthermore, the following factors are considered: level of rentals in any secondary period compared with market rates, contingent payments, renewal and purchase options, costs relating to the termination of the lease and the signing of a new replacement lease, costs to return the underlying asset, nature and the level of specialization of the leased assets, asset location, availability of suitable alternatives and existence of significant leasehold improvements. See Note 23.									
								
									
#### Lease liability incremental borrowing rate determination under IFRS 16 (Group as a Lessee)									
									
The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.																	
The Group has used market rates in each of the countries as its incremental borrowing rate. The discount rate applied is obtained from official state government institutions as the average market rate available at the beginning of the lease agreement for loans over a similar term, security, value and applied  in similar economic environment. The Group considers market rates used as an appropriate measure for incremental borrowing rates as they correctly reflect the ability the respective subsidiary to finance a specific asset purchase in each of the jurisdictions given the Group’s wide geographical coverage, its track record in ability to raise public debt and the overall financial results of the Group and each subsidiary individually. 									
									
As additional factor considered is the way how local lenders would approach the asset financing at each subsidiary level. The two most important factors assessed would be the potential borrower’s (in this case Group’s subsidiary’s) financial position and the asset that is being financed (i.e. the quality of the security). As per Group’s assessment each of the Group’s subsidiaries would qualify as a good quality borrower in the local markets in the context of overall Group results.

### 3. Significant accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions (continued)									
									
#### Lease classification for rental fleet (Group as a Lessor)									
									
The Group has entered into vehicle leases on its rental fleet (Note 22). These lease agreements have a non-cancellable term of 6 months and an optional term of up to 72 months. After the non-cancellable term of 6 months the lessee can return the leased asset to the Group and losses associated with the cancellation are borne by the Group. The leased asset is not transferred to lessee at the end of lease term. The Group has determined, based on an evaluation of the terms and conditions of the arrangements, such as the lease term not constituting a major part of the economic life of the leased assets and the present value of the minimum lease payments not amounting to substantially all of the fair value of the leased asset, that it retains all the significant risks and rewards of ownership of these assets and accounts for the contracts as operating leases.									
								
									
#### Sale and leaseback transactions									
									
Under sale and leaseback transactions the Group purchases the underlying asset and then leases it back to the same customer. To determine how to account for a sale and leaseback transaction, the Group first considers whether the initial transfer of the underlying asset from the seller-lessee (Customer) to the buyer-lessor (the Group) is a sale. The Group applies IFRS 15 to determine whether a sale has taken place.  The key indicators that control has passed to the Group include the Group having:
- a present obligation to pay; 
- physical possession (of the purchased asset); 
- a legal title (to the purchased asset); 
- the risks and rewards of ownership (of the purchased asset); 
- the Group has accepted the asset;                                                - the borrower can or must repurchase the asset for an amount that is less than the original selling price of the asset.								
								
In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are SPPI, the Group considers the contractual terms of the instrument.  This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making the assessment, the Group considers: 
- contingent events that would change the amount and timing of cash flows;
- leverage features;
- prepayment and extension terms;
- terms that limit the Group’s claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse loans); and
- features that modify consideration of the time value of money (e.g. periodical reset of interest rates).																
Please refer to Note 2 for further detailed descriptions of the judgements made by management to assess whether regular loan, non-recourse loan and sale and leaseback financing arrangement contracts meet SPPI criteria. 									
									
									
									
#### Measurement of fair values									
									
Trademarks obtained in business combinations during 2023
									
The Relief-from-royalty method was used  for measuring the fair value of trademarks obtained. The relief from-royalty method considers the discounted estimated royalty payments that are expected to be avoided as a result of the patents or trademarks being owned.
Management’s  key assumptions used to determine the value of trademarks were as follows:
Average cash flow forecast (5 Year) revenue growth rate is 19% per year (range 10% - 37%)
Long term revenue growth rate is 0% as a matter of prudence for fair value estimation.
Average trademark royalty rate is 0.9% (range 0.9% - 1.1%)
Average discount rate is 25.4% (range 22.2% - 32.0%)"						

Property, plant and equipment obtained in business combinations	

Depreciated replacement cost technique was used for measuring the fair value of Property, plant and equipment obtained. Depreciated replacement cost reflects adjustments for physical deterioration as well as functional and economic obsolescence of assets obtained.									
									
									
Other intangible assets obtained in business combinations
									
The With and Without Method (WWM) was used for measuring fair value of DAS Access asset acquired. The WWM estimates an intangible asset’s value by calculating the difference between two discounted cash-flow models: one that represents the status quo for the business enterprise with the asset in place, and another without it. Management’s  key assumptions used to determine the value of DAS Asset were as follows:
Loan issuance growth rate is 18%
Long term growth rate is 0% as a matter of prudence for fair value estimation.
Expected Loss (EL) for DAS loans issued: With asset is 8.0%; Without asset is 25.0%
Discount rate is 32%																
									
Depreciated replacement cost technique was used for measuring the fair value of Intangible assets obtained (excluding Trademarks and DAS Access Asset). Depreciated replacement cost reflects adjustments for functional and economic obsolescence of assets obtained.																
Please refer to Note 47 for disclosure of and relevant inputs for fair value techniques applied to financial assets and liabilities.									
									
									
#### Obtaining control over obtained entities									
									
During 2023 the Group obtained several new subsidiaries in a transaction where legal ownership of the companies was obtained through obtaining of a holding entity EC Finance Group SIA. The Group assumed full control over the newly obtained entities from the moment of signing the agreements since they include clauses granting the Group the power to govern the obtained entities from day of signing the share obtaining agreements. Accordingly, the Group concluded that control in accordance with IFRS 10 was exercised and commenced consolidation of the subsidiaries. The management of Eleving Group S.A. evaluated whether the acquisition of EC Finance Group SIA is considered as “transaction under common control”, whereas such transactions are outside of the scope of IFRS 3 “Business combinations”. Such evaluation was performed due to the fact that CI Holding AS and Eleving Group S.A. has overlapping shareholders. However, after careful consideration and interpretation of IFRS Accounting Policies, the management determined that the transaction should not be treated as under common control. This determination was made due to the impact of the transaction on minority shareholders, leading the management to conclude that the acquisition method prescribed by IFRS 3 should be applied. Consequently, the transaction falls within the scope of IFRS 3 for business combinations.

### 3. Significant accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions (continued)									
									
									
#### Disposal groups and discontinued operations 																	
At the end of 2021 the Group made a decision to fully exit the Balkan region with its car financing business as well as in late 2023 the Group decided to exit also from Belarus.																	
As a result of these decisions some entities have been sold or were in sales negotiations at the end of 2023, but for some entities the process of liquidation has been initiated with a plan to complete the liquidation in nearest future. Due to these reasons all of the following group subsidiaries as at 31 December 2023 are classified as subsidiaries held for sale or under liquidation and discontinued operations:														
- Mogo Leasing d.o.o. (Bosnia&Herzegovina) – under liquidation;
- Mogo Albania SHA – sold in 2022;
- Rocket Leasing OOO – sold in early 2024;
- Autotrade OOO – sold in early 2024;
- MOGO Kredit LLC – sold in early 2024.

During 2022 and 2023 the Group performed cessions of doubtful finance lease receivables as well as doubtful loans and advances to customers receivables to non related parties.
The Group uses opportunities to sell receivables in cession to improve cash flow and reduce debt collection related expenses associated of recovering of doubtful debts.

When financial lease receivables or loans and advances to customers portfolio is sold in cession the Group reverses the respective part of impairment allowance of the ceded
assets (Note 24 and 25).

The Group then separately recognizes net losses arising from derecognition of the ceded portfolio, which is reduced by the respective cession income.

Subsequently, an extensive investigation encompassing financial years 2022 and 2023 was conducted to ascertain the extent of transactions under the review. The investigation concluded with the assessment that the misappropriation of funds in the amount of slightly more than EUR 500 000 had taken place and funds were deemed to be largely irrecoverable for the time being, thus expensed within the respective periods in the subsidiary's financial records with the effect to Group’s Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss amounting to EUR 191 190. This amount has been duly reflected in the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements.

Recognition of deferred taxes mainly is driven from accumulated tax losses from entities in Mauritius and Uganda as well as temporary differences in taxable impairment in
Kenya.

Deferred tax assets have not been recognized mainly in respect to tax losses arisen in Luxembourg and Ukraine as there may be no future taxable profits available in the
foreseeable future. Subsidiaries in Ukraine have been loss-making and there are no other tax planning opportunities or other evidence of recoverability in the near future. Recoverability of deferred tax asset in Luxembourg in nearest future is also unlikely.

Deferred tax asset not recognized due to the above reason in amount of 8 548 066 EUR. (2022: 10 413 879 EUR).

The potential income tax consequence attached to the payment of dividends in 2023 amounts to 624 736 EUR. (2022: 1 350 317 EUR.)

Goodwill and trademarks impairment test

As at 31 December 2023, goodwill and trademarks were tested for impairment.

The impairment test was performed for each cash generating unit separately.

The recoverable amounts for each unit were calculated based on their value in use, determined by discounting the future cash flows expected to be generated from the continuing activities of the units. No impairment losses were recognized because the recoverable amounts of these units including the goodwill allocated were determined to be higher than their carrying amounts. The calculations of value-in-use were based on free cash flow to equity approach to each unit respectively, discounted by estimated cost of equity. The value-in-use calculations are most sensitive to projected operating cash-flow, terminal growth rates used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budget period, and discount rates. Projected operating cash-flow figures were based on detailed financial models.

2023 actual figures were used as a starting point in these models, and took into account management's expectations of the future performance of each unit.


Five years of cash flows were included in the discounted cash flow model. A long-term terminal growth rate into perpetuity was determined to be 1%. The rate was
estimated by management based on historical trends observed in existing markets, and expected Group and industry developments.

Discount rates reflect the current market assessment of the risk specific to each unit.

Sensitivity analysis was performed to assess changes to key assumptions that could influence whether the carrying value of the units exceeded their recoverable
amounts. The results of this analysis indicate that for all units, the recoverable amount would not be below the carrying amount including goodwill (i.e. goodwill would not
become impaired), if terminal growth rates decreased by 0.5% and discount rates increased by 5%.

*Impairment test of non-financial assets (long term rental fleet)


As of 31 December 2023, non-financial assets of long term rental fleet were tested for impairment. An impairment indication existed as Renti AS has been loss making since its establishment and only in year 2022 started generating the profit.


Out of total rental fleet with the acquisition cost of EUR 6 725 035, impairment was identified for the total rental fleet with a acquisition cost of EUR 525 571. For those cars recoverable amount is estimated to EUR 169 742. The recoverable amount was estimated based on the value in use method discounting the cash-flow using a WACC of 12.6%. The cash-flow was projected based on rental agreements probabilities of default and early repayments. As a result, impairment loss was recognised in previous years and remaining impairment amount as at 31 December is EUR 75 398.


For the remaining rental fleet with the acquisition value of EUR 6 199 464, the recoverable amount was estimated as EUR 3 390 086.


Sensitivity analysis was performed to assess changes to key assumptions that could influence whether the carrying value of the rental fleet assets exceeded their recoverable amounts. If WACC would have increased by 2%, all other assumptions remaining the same including the rental income, acquisition cost would increase to EUR 546 116 and the recoverable amount of impaired assets would equal to EUR 178 637, additional impairment of EUR 1 580 would need to be recognized.

For detailed description of impairment testing refer to ‘Impairment of non-financial assets (rental fleet) (Note 3).


Impairment test of non-financial assets (car sharing rental fleet)

As of 31 December 2023, non-financial assets of car sharing rental fleet were tested for impairment. The Group did not identify any indicators requiring recognition of any impairment.

On the 1 January 2017 the subsidiary in Lithuania 'Mogo LT UAB' entered into a Credit Default Swap (CDS) agreement with another subsidiary in Estonia 'Risk Management Services OU'. On the basis of CDS all leasing and loan agreements issued by the Lithuanian subsidiary are secured by the CDS and are transferred to 'Risk Management Services OU' if the client of leasing or loan agreement is late in paying the debt for more than 125 days. Due to this reason, in 2017 impairment was reversed and no impairment is calculated onwards for Lithuanian subsidiary. Due to the signed Credit Default Swap agreement with Risk Management Services OU the loan agreements are insured and in case of customer insolvency and Mogo LT UAB receives a payment from Risk Management Services OU. During 2021 also Renti LT UAB signed the same type of agreement with the same conditions.


As of 1 January 2022 'Risk Management Services OU' is no longer considered a related party since it has been disposed from the group in 2020.

* Transactions with peer-to-peer platforms

From year 2016 the Group started placing lease agreement receivables on peer-to-peer lending platform. Agreements were offered with buy back guarantee, which means that all risks of such agreements remain with the Group and in case of client default the Group has the liability to repay the whole remaining principal and accrued interest to P2P investor. By using the same platform the Group also offered loans without buy back guarantee, which means that all risks related to client default were transferred to P2P investor. Portions of agreements purchased by investors are therefore considered as financial assets eligible for derecognition from the Group's statement of financial position.


Total gross portfolio and associated liabilities for the portfolio derecognized from Group financial assets were:

### 32. Other receivables (continued)


* - All receivables are due within the following year, except VAT overpayment where the date of settlement is unclear due to ongoing litigation process in Latvia.


This resulted in full settlement of payable VAT and recognition of VAT overpayment. Considering the uncertainty disclosed in Note 37, the Group has decided to recognize the impairment provision in full amount for VAT receivable in the statement of financial position and additional provisions in amount of VAT payable settled by VAT return adjustment and related penalties (see Note 37).


** - The Group enters into currency exchange transactions where it tries to limit its foreign currency rate fluctuation loss. The transaction requires the Group to reserve the a cash deposit with its currency transaction partners. At year end the Group recognizes accrued income based on year end currency rates versus agreed currency transaction rates and recognizes income if the estimated result is expected to be profitable.


*** - The Georgian tax administration has initiated a transfer pricing audit for Mogo LLC (Georgia). The audit covers the financial years 2016, 2017 and 2018. Additional audit has been initiated for financial years 2019 and 2020. Audit decisions have been issued for respective year. The Georgian tax administration has challenged that interest rate applied by Eleving Group S.A. on loan issued to Mogo LLC complies with arm’s lengths principle. According to the decisions additional tax amount of EUR 911 322 has been assessed. The amount has been withheld by the Georgian tax administration from a tax overpayment of Mogo LLC, and part of the amount has been transferred to the Georgian state budget by Mogo LLC.

Mogo LLC has appealed the decisions.

The tax audit decisions for have been appealed within Tbilisi City Court.


Group’s management has made a decision to apply for a mutual agreement procedure according to the double tax treaty concluded between Georgia and Luxembourg. In 2022 the Group has submitted the application within the Luxembourg tax administration to initiate mutual agreement procedure. The tax administration is assessing the application.


The management of the Group considers that the interest rate applied by Eleving Group S.A. on loans issued to related parties fully complies with the arm’s length principle. The applied interest rate is justified by transfer pricing policies held by the Group. The management of the Group considers that the approach of the Georgian tax administration does not comply with basic loan pricing principles and international guidelines. In order to determine the market interest rate for the Eleving Group S.A. loan issued to the Mogo LLC, Georgian tax administration has used coupon rate of bonds issued by credit institutions as a comparable source. The coupon rates of such bonds are not comparable as represents lower risk market comparing with that where the Group operates. Additionally, when issuing the decision Georgian tax administration has not considered borrowing
costs of Eleving Group S.A. The interest rate applied by the Georgian tax administration in the decisions is significantly lower than the borrowing costs of Eleving Group S.A.


The Group is in a position to use all available local and international measures to justify its transfer pricing policies and to achieve the result that the decisions are fully cancelled. According to management’s best estimate no significant economical outflows in relation to the transfer pricing audit is expected in the future as the possibility of such has been assessed as remote.

The Group management expects to fully recover paid tax.

The Group has not calculated an ECL allowance for cash and cash equivalents on the basis that placements with banks are of short term nature and the lifetime of these assets under IFRS 9 is so short that the low probability of default would result in immaterial ECL amounts (2022: EUR 0).


The Group cooperates with banks with credit ratings no less than BBB-.


The Group also does not keep large amounts of funds in one specific bank to limit concentration risk and high exposure to small amount of banks.

### 43. Other financial liabilities

On 16 January 2020, the Group acquired an additional 2% interest in the shares of Mogo LLC (Georgia), increasing its ownership interest to 100%. As part of the purchase agreement with the previous non-controlling interest holder of Mogo LLC (Georgia), a contingent consideration has been agreed. There will be additional cash payments to the
previous non-controlling interest holder of:

1) 2% of the net profit earned by Mogo LLC for the years 2019 through 2021;
2) Additional annual amounts of GEL 82 836 for the years 2019-2021.

As at the additional interest acquisition date, the fair value of the contingent consideration was estimated to be 212 988 EUR based on the expected probable outcome. During 2020, 2021 and 2022 the Group settled part of the liabilities. Value of remaining amount was reassessed and additional income was recognized in 2022.


The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the contingent consideration are disclosed in Note 3.

The contingent consideration liability is due for yearly measurement and payment to the former non-controlling interest holder after issuance of the respective year’s annual report. Contingent consideration liability is recognized as follows:

### 46. Financial risk management


The risk management function within the Group is carried out in respect of financial risks, operational risks and legal risks. Financial risk comprises market risk (including currency risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The primary objectives of the financial risk management function are to establish risk limits, and then ensure that exposure to risks stays within these limits. The operational and legal risk management functions are intended to ensure proper functioning of internal policies and procedures, in order to minimize operational and legal risks.

#### Operational risks

The Group takes on exposure to certain operational risks, which result from general and specific market and industry requirements. 


 Compliance risk
Compliance risk refers to the risk of losses or business process disruption resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes systems, that have resulted in a breach of applicable law or other regulation currently in place.


 Regulatory risks
Group’s operations are subject to regulation by a variety of consumer protection, financial services and other state authorities in various jurisdictions, including, but not limited to, laws and regulations relating to consumer loans and consumer rights protection, debt collection and personal data processing. Formal licences issued by respective regulators are required in all countries where the Group operates in, except for Lithuania, Georgia, Belarus, Moldova, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Poland. The Group closely monitors all the changes in regulatory framework for each of the countries it operates in. The Group employs both in-house as well as outsourced legal specialists to assist in addressing any current or future regulatory developments that might have an impact on Group’s business activities.

### 46. Financial risk management (continued)


 Anti-money laundering and Know Your Customer laws compliance risk

The Group is subject to anti-money laundering laws and related compliance obligations in most of the jurisdictions in which it does business. The Group has put in place local antimoney laundering policies in those jurisdictions where it is required under local law to do so and in certain other jurisdictions. As a financial institution, the Group is required to comply with anti-money laundering regulations that are generally less restrictive than those that apply to banks.
As a result, the Group often relies on anti-money laundering and know your customer checks performed by our customers’ banks when such customers open new bank accounts, however Group has implemented further internal policies to minimise these risks. Group has put in place internal control framework to identify and report all suspicious transactions with a combination of IT based solutions and human involvement. Internal policies of the Group typically include customers’ background check against sanctioned lists and other public sources as required by each local law.

 Privacy, data protection compliance risk

The Group’s business is subject to a variety of laws and regulations internationally that involve user privacy, data protection, advertising, marketing, disclosures, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection and online payment services. The Group has put in place an internal control framework consisting from a combination of IT based solutions and business procedures that are designed to capture any potential non-compliance matter before it has occurred and to ensure compliance with these requirements.


#### Market risks

The Group takes on exposure to market risks, which are the risks that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risks arise from open positions in interest rate and currency products, all of which are exposed to general and specific market movements and changes in the level of volatility or market rates or prices such as interest rates and foreign exchange rates.

#### Financial risks

The main financial risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and credit risk.

 Foreign currency risk

The Group accepts the currency risk by issuing loans in local currencies and funding local operations mostly with EUR. Further currency risk is managed transaction wise by avoiding unnecessary conversions back and forth to settle payments and invoices in EUR. Also Group is constantly looking for ways to fund local country operations with local currency funds.

The currency risk is defined as the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Group is exposed to the effects of fluctuations in the prevailing foreign currency exchange rates on its financial position and cash flows.

The most significant foreign currency exposure comes from Armenia, Georgia, Moldova, Kenya, Uganda, and Uzbekistan, where Group has evaluated potential hedging options, but due to the costs associated with it, has decided not to pursue hedging strategy for now and assume potential short to mid-term currency fluctuations with retaining potential upside from strengthening in those currencies. The Group has always operated with a forex loss being a legitimate and always present cost item that was adequately priced within each non-EUR country's product portfolio.
It is expected that Group’s exposure to volatile foreign currencies will be continuing to decrease in future with Group’s divestment of several of its subsidiaries. Additionally, the Group has started to proactively manage to foreign currency exposure risk towards USD, since in several of Group’s largest markets local loan portfolios are linked to USD. The proactive management of USD exposure can be observed by forward contract purchases that have started already in 2020 and continued to do so in 2021, 2022 and 2023.

The Group is not exposed to currency risk in Bosnia&Herzegovina since currency rate is fixed by national bank.

 Interest rate risk

The Company is exposed to interest rate risk through its issued subordinated bond which carries a coupon of 12% plus 6 month Euribor and floating coupon notes in Kenya. However, due to its relatively low size in terms of total borrowings (5% from total borrowings as at end of 2023), which in turn are fixed rate, the Company believes its revenue will be sufficient to cover the increased borrowings costs from subordinated bonds.

**Financial risks**

Capital risk management
The Group considers both equity capital as well as borrowings a part of overall capital risk management strategy. 
The Group manages its capital to ensure that it will be able to continue as going concern. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may attract new credit facilities or increase its share capital. The Group fulfils externally imposed equity capital requirements as stated in Note 45.

The Group monitors equity capital on the basis of the capitalization ratio as defined in Eurobond prospectus. This ratio is calculated as Net worth (the sum of paid in capital, retained earnings, reserves and shareholder loan) divided by Net Loan portfolio. In order to maintain or adjust the overall capital structure, the Group may issue new bonds, borrow in P2P platform or sell assets to reduce debt.  The management of the borrowings is driven by monitoring and complying the lender imposed covenants as well as planning the further borrowing needs to ensure business development of the Group.


 Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. The Group manages its liquidity risk by arranging an adequate amount of committed credit facilities with related parties, P2P investors and by issuing bonds. The Group monitors daily cash flows and plans for milestone dates for cash outflows to cover major liabilities like semi-annual interest payments for Eurobonds. The Group regulates its issuances of new loans to ensure the adequate funds are available when upcoming larger settlement of liabilities is approaching.

The Group is exposed to credit risk through its finance lease receivables, loans and advances to customers, loans to related parties, trade and other receivables as well as cash and cash equivalents. Maximum credit risk exposure is represented by the gross carrying value of the respective financial assets. The key areas of credit risk policy cover lease granting process (including solvency check of the lease), monitoring methods, as well as decision making principles.

The Group collateralizes the finance lease assets it finances and provides loans in amount of no more than 85% of the market values of the collateral.

The Group operates by applying a clear set of finance lease granting criteria. This criteria includes assessing the credit history of customer, means of lease repayment and understanding the lease object. The Group takes into consideration both quantitative and qualitative factors when assessing the creditworthiness of the customer. Based on this analysis, the Group sets the credit limit for each and every customer.

When the lease agreement has been signed, the Group monitors the lease object and customer’s solvency. The Group has developed lease monitoring process so that it helps to quickly spot any possible non-compliance with the provisions of the agreement. The receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is minimized, and, where appropriate, provisions are being made.

The Group does not have a significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty, but has risk to group of counterparties having similar characteristics.


 Excessive risk concentration

Concentrations arise when a number of counterparties are engaged in similar business activities, or activities in the same geographical region, or have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic, political or other conditions. Concentrations indicate the relative sensitivity of the Group’s performance to developments affecting a particular industry or geographical location.

In order to avoid excessive concentrations of risk, the Group is maintaining a diversified portfolio. It’s main product is subprime lease, however it is offering also near prime lease, as well as instalment loan and long-term rent products.

 Climate-related risk

‘Climate-related risks’ are potential negative impacts on the Group arising from climate change. Climate-related risks have an impact on the principal risk categories discussed above (i.e. credit, liquidity, market and operational risks), but due to their pervasive nature have been identified and managed by the Group on an overall basis.


The Group distinguishes between physical risks and transition risks. Physical risks arise as the result of acute weather events such as hurricanes, floods and wildfires, and longerterm shifts in climate patterns, such as sustained higher temperatures, heat waves, droughts and rising sea levels. Transition risks arise as a result of measures taken to mitigate the effects of climate change and transition to a low-carbon economy – e.g. changes to laws and regulations, litigation due to failure to mitigate or adapt, and shifts in supply and demand for certain commodities, products and services due to changes in consumer behaviour and investor demand.

The Group has incorporated Climate related risks into a broader ESG policy that aims to assess the materiality of focus areas as well as defines future goals for 2025 (including climate related ones). The Group also reports on the extent to which its portfolio is associated with economic activities that are eligible to qualify as environmentally sustainable under the EU Taxonomy regulation.

### 47. Fair value of financial assets and liabilities


Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:
- In the principal market for the asset or liability, or
- In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group.

The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to
measure fair value, maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorized within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:

- Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
- Level 2 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable
- Level 3 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.

Instruments within Level 1 include highly liquid assets and standard derivative financial instruments traded on the stock exchange. 
Fair value for such financial instruments as Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss is mainly determined based on publicly available quoted prices (bid price, obtainable from Bloomberg system).


Instruments within Level 2 include assets, for which no active market exists, such as over the counter derivative financial instruments that are traded outside the stock exchange, bonds, as well as balances on demand with the central banks, balances due from banks and other financial liabilities. Bonds fair value is observable in Frankfurt Stock Exchange public information. Fair value of bank loans is based on effective interest rate which represents current market rate to similar companies. The management recognizes that cash and cash equivalents' fair value is the same as their carrying value therefore the risk of fair value change is insignificant.


Instruments within Level 3 include loans and receivables.

Fair value of finance lease receivables and loans and advances to customers is determined using discounted cash flow model consisting of contractual lease and loan cash flows that are adjusted by expectations about possible variations in the amount and timings of cash flows using methodology consistent with the expected credit loss determination as at 31 December 2023 to determine the cash flows expected to be received net of impairment losses. The pre-tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of the entity holding the respective financial assets is used as the basis for the discount rate. The WACC is based on the actual estimated cost of equity and cost of debt that reflect any other risks relevant to the leases and loans that have not been taken into consideration by the impairment loss adjustment described above and also includes compensation for the opportunity cost of establishing a similar lease or loan. An additional 1.5 to 4.1% is added to the discount rate as an adjustment to consider service costs of the portfolio that are not captured by the cash flow adjustments.

The annual discount rate was determined between 11.04% and 20.82% depending on the Group’s component holding the respective financial asset. Impairment loss is estimated by applying PD and LGD rates, which are in line with ECL methodology described under 'The calculation of ECLs' (Note 2).

The table below summarizes the carrying amounts and fair values of those financial assets and liabilities not presented on the Group’s statement of financial position at their fair
value:

### 48. Share-based payments

#### General Employee Share Option Plan

The Group may grant share options of Subsidiaries to its employees. Share options are generally awarded on the first day of employment. The share options vest within four years time with front loaded vesting of 25% of the granted shares after one year of employment. The maximum term of options granted is 4 years.

#### Fair value of the respective share options

The fair value of share options granted is estimated at the date of grant. Group’s management has assessed that the fair value of the respective share options, due to reasons described in Note 3 is not material. Accordingly, no expense and liability arising from these equity-settled share-based payment transactions is recognized.


The exercise price of the share options under typical circumstances is equal to the nominal price of the underlying shares. The contractual maximum term of the share options are till 2025. There are cash settlement alternatives. Given absence of an ongoing sale of subsidiaries or Eleving Group S.A. or any listing process initiated and any other relevant cash settlement events, cash settlement is considered not to be probable. The Group does not have a past practice of cash settlement for these awards and the Group does not have a present obligation to settle in cash.

## REPORT  OF THE REVISEUR  D'ENTREPRISES  AGREE
To the Shareholders  of
Eleving Group
Société anonyme
8-10, Avenue de la Gare
L - 1610 Luxembourg


### Report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements

Opinion

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Eleving Group and its subsidiaries  (the“Group”), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2023, and the consolidated statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes  in equity and consolidated statement of cash  flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including material accounting policy information and other explanatory information.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 31 December  2023, and of its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash  flows for the year then ended in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards  as adopted by the European Union.

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the EU Regulation N* 537/2014, the Law of 23 July 2016  on the audit profession (“Law of 23 July 2016”) and with International Standards  on
Auditing (“ISAs”) as adopted for Luxembourg by the “Commission de Surveillance du SecteurFinancier” (“CSSF”). Our responsibilities under the EU regulation N* 537/2014, the Law of 23 July 2016 and ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF  are further described in the « Responsibilities of the “réviseur d'entreprises agréé” for the audit of the consolidated
financial statements » section of our report. We are also independent of the Group in accordance with the International Code  of Ethics for Professional  Accountants, including
International Independence Standards, issued by the International Ethics Standards  Board for Accountants (IESBA  Code)  as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF  together with the ethical requirements that are relevant  to our audit of the consolidated financial statements, and have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities under those ethical requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis  for our opinion.

Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed  in the context of the audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Key Audit Matter:

 Impairment allowance for “Finance lease receivables” and “Loans and advances to customers”

The total net value of "Finance lease receivables" and "Loans and advances to customers" (together  the "portfolio") amounts  to EUR 313 204 155 and represents approximately
74% of the Groups total assets at 31 December 2023 (31 December  2022: EUR 282954 69%4 and approximately 78%). The portfolio consists mainly of both secured and unsecured
loans.

The Group's management  estimates the amount of the impairment allowance in accordance  with the expected credit loss (ECL)  model under IFRS 9. Expected credit losses  for the entire portfolio are determined by grouping them, applying
modelling techniques based on historical loss rates and changes in the. portfolio's risk characteristics adjusted for forward-looking information.

The main parameters used in the model include those related  to probability of default ('PD'),  loss given default (LGD') and exposure at default (EAD).

Management needs  to make critical judgements in order to identify, in a timely manner, portions of the portfolio with significant increases in credit risk and impaired exposures.

In view of the above, we have identified this as
a key audit matter.


How the Key Audit Matter  was addressed in our audit:

Our audit procedures included amonsgst others:

- We tested control environment related to the approval and issuance of loans, the identification of defaults and the collection of debts.

- We engaged  IT specialists to test the overall IT environment and the effectiveness of controls over the systems supporting
portfolio accounting and ECL calculation.

- We tested the accounting policies, management assumptions and data used to estimate the probability of default and loss given default rates. We tested the completeness and accuracy of the data used to calculate the provision for impairment losses.

- We tested selected key controls over the validation and posting of credits and the testing and validation of key ECL model inputs and outputs.

- We also tested management's  assessment  of the impact of macro factors on the quality of the loan portfolio and other related considerations.

- We performed other substantive and analytical procedures.

- We tested the completeness and accuracy of the disclosures relating to originated loans, impairment allowance and losses  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Key Audit Matter:

 Interest income recognition


For the year ended 31 December  2023, interest income from "Finance lease receivables” and "Loans  and advances  to customers" totaled EUR 176 297 775 and represented approximately 92% of the Group's  total income and other revenue (31 December 2022: EUR 162 516 856 andapproximately 91%).

In accordance with IFRS 9 - Recognized  interest income is determined using the effective interest rate ("EIR")  method. In determining the amount of interest income, the Group uses a
model whereby automatically calculated interest amounts are manually adjusted based on the contractual interest rate to reflect the additional costs incurred in entering into the
lease and loan agreement in the ElR measurement and the resulting interest income is recognized in the income statement.

The calculation of interest income is performed using sophisticated information technology systems that process frequently updated and voluminous data.

In view of the above, we have identified this as a key audit matter.

How the Key Audit Matter was addressed in our audit:

Our audit procedures included amongst others:

- We tested the accounting policies, management assumptions and inputs used in the recognition of interest  income.

- We engaged IT specialists who tested the effectiveness of the overall IT environment and controls over the systems supporting the calculation of interest income.

- We tested the design and implementation of selected controls over the interest revenue recognition process, controls over the application of appropriate contractual interest rates and other contractual terms in the interest revenue recognition process and controls over the review and validation of manual accounting entries used in the EIR valuation.

- We performed other substantive and analytical procedures.

- We tested the completeness and accuracyof the disclosures retating to interest income in the notes to the consolidated
financial statements.


Other information

The Board of Directors is responsible for the other  information. The other information comprises the information included in the consolidated management report and the Corporate Governance Statement but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our report of “réviseurd'entreprises agréé” thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does  not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other  information and, in doing so, consider  whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears  to be materially misstated. If, based  on the work we have performed, we conclude that there  is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and Those Charged with Governance for the consolidated financial statements


The Board of Directors is responsible  for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards  as adopted by
the European Union, and for such  internal control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary  to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

The Board of Directors is responsible for presenting the consolidated financial statements in compliance with the requirements set out in the Delegated Regulation 2019/815 on European Single Electronic Format (“ESEF  Regulation”).

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing  the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis  of accounting unless  the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease  operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those  charged with governance  are responsible for overseeing  the Group's financial reporting process.

####
Responsibilities of the “réviseur d'entreprises agréé” for the audit of the consolidated financial statements

The objectives of our audit are to obtain reasonable assurance  about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether  due to fraud or error, and to issue a report of “reviseur d'entreprises agréé” that includes our opinion. Reasonable  assurance  is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the EU Regulation N* 537/2014, the Law of 23 July 2016 and with ISAs  as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF  will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably  be expected to influence the economic decisions of users  taken
on the basis  of these consolidated financial statements.

Our responsibility is to assess  whether the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in all material respects with the requirements laid down in the ESEF  Regulation.

As part of an audit in accordance  with the EU Regulation N* 537/2014, the Law of 23 July 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF,  we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

 Identify and assess  the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design  and perform audit procedures responsive  to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis  for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing  an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.

 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used  and the reasonableness  of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors.

 Conclude  on the appropriateness of Board of Directors's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit  evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our report of the “reviseurd'entreprises agréé” to the related disclosures  in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions  are based  on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report of
the “réviseur d'entreprises agréé”. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves  fair presentation.

 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities and business  activities within the Group  to express  an opinion on the
consolidated financial statements. We are responsible  for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.


We communicate with  those charged with governance regarding, among  other matters, the planned scope  and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance  with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear  on our independence,
and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards  applied.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were  of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.
